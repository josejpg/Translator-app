Frequently-Used Buttons  
Cancel  
Closing a dialog with Cancel, shuts it without saving any changes made.  
Floating Toolbar  
By single-clicking several icons you open floating toolbars.  
These are menu windows containing commands you can choose from.  
Click and hold down the mouse button on the title bar and drag it away from the object bar.  
As soon as you release the mouse button the floating toolbar remains at the new position.  
You can then click on the title bar and drag the toolbar to another position, or close it by clicking the Close Window symbol.  
Spin box  
In the text box here, enter the numerical value or select it with the up-arrow or down-arrow buttons.  
On the keyboard you can use the (up-arrow)and (down-arrow) keys to increase or reduce the value in the spin button, whilst you can use (Image up) and (Image down)to set the maximum and minimum value for this spin button.  
If the spin box defines numerical values, you can also define a measurement unit, e.g., 1 cm or 5 mm, 12 pt or 2 ".  
Convert  
If you click forwards through the dialog, this button is called Next.  
On the last page you can change its name to Convert.  
The conversion is then performed by pressing the button.  
Context Menu  
Some context menus can be called even if the object has not been selected.  
Context menus are found just about everywhere in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Delete...  
Deletes the selected element or elements after confirmation.  
Delete  
Deletes the selected element or elements without requiring conformation.  
Metric  
You can enter values in the input fields in different units of measurement.  
The default unit is inches.  
However, if you want a space of exactly 1cm, then enter 1cm.  
Additional units are available according to the context, e.g.  
12 pt for a 12 point spacing.  
If the value of the new unit is unrealistic, the program uses a predefined maximum or minimum value.  
Close  
Closes the dialog and saves all changes.  
Close  
Closes the dialog.  
Default

Terminology Made Easy - Internet Glossary  
To make your first steps easier, this glossary explains some of the more important terminology you may meet in the Internet, intranet, mail and news.  
If you are a newcomer to the Internet, you will be confronted with unfamiliar terms: browser, bookmark, e-mail, homepage, search engine, and many others.  
Don't worry - we explain these and other terms right here.  
Click the required term or browse through the descriptions:  
Applet, Bookmark, Browser, E-Mail, Frame, FTP, HTML, HTTP, Hyperlink, ImageMap, Intranet, Java, PlugIn, Proxy, Server, SGML, SMTP/POP3, Style Sheets, Search engine, Tags, TCP/IP, URL, Webserver, XML.  
Applet  
In the Internet language, an Applet refers to a special object contained on an HTML page.  
It contains a program written in Java, the most widespread Internet language.  
The object on the page may represent an animation, not as single images loaded from the Internet, but as a separate program executed by your Web browser.  
Applets are used for animations, animated text, interactive user input, games and much more.  
Under %PRODUCTNAME, you can insert Applets, self-programmed or downloaded from the Internet into your pages, choose Insert - Object - Applet.  
These can be viewed by anyone using a web browser supporting Applets.  
All other browsers simply ignore the Applets.  
Visit http://www.gamelan.com for some examples.  
Bookmark  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can set a bookmark on the current help page in the help window.  
Browser  
A web browser can display formatted pages that are encoded in HTML document format.  
E-Mail  
E-mail stands for electronic mail and is sent in a communication system, for example the Internet.  
E-mails can contain information in the form of text, images, sounds and other attachments.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can, for example, in File - Send send the current document as an e-mail attachment.  
This starts your default e-mail program.  
Frames  
Frames are an important element in the optical design of HTML pages.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can insert floating frames.  
These frames can incorporate objects, i.e. graphics, movie files, sounds, etc. and can be inserted in HTML pages.  
The context menu of such a frame shows the available options for restoring or editing frame contents; some of these options are also under Edit - Object, when the frame is selected.  
FTP  
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and is the standard transfer protocol for files in the Internet.  
An FTP server is a program on a computer connected to the Internet, which stores files to be transmitted with the aid of FTP.  
While FTP is responsible for transmitting and downloading Internet files, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) provides the connection setup and data transfer between WWW servers and clients.  
HTML  
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a document code language, which is used as the file format for WWW documents.  
It is derived from SGML and integrates text, graphics, videos and sound.  
HTML (detailed explanation).  
HTML (detailed description)  
If you want to enter HTML commands directly (for example when doing exercises from one of the many available HTML books), remember that HTML pages are pure text files in 7-bit ASCII code.  
Save your document, typed directly in HTML code without umlauts and other special characters of the extended character set, under the document type Text DOS.  
Give it the file name extension .HTM.  
If you later want to open this file in %PRODUCTNAME and edit the HTML code, you must load it with the file type Text DOS and not with the file type HTML.  
There are several references in the Internet providing an introduction to the HTML language.  
HTTP  
The HyperText Transfer Protocol is a record of transmission of WWW documents between WWW servers (hosts) and browsers (clients).  
Hyperlink  
Hyperlinks are cross-references, highlighted in text in various colors and activated by mouse-click.  
With the aid of hyperlinks, readers can jump to specific information within a document as well as to related information in other documents.  
In the Internet it is common, for example, to include hyperlinks on your own homepage, referring to other Internet sites.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can assign hyperlinks to text (see Hyperlink bar) as well as to graphics and text frames (see the Hyperlink tab page in the Graphic/Frames/Object dialog and the menu command Edit - ImageMap).  
ImageMap  
An ImageMap is a reference-sensitive graphic or a text frame.  
You can click on defined areas of the graphic or text frame to go to a target (URL), which is linked with the area.  
The reference areas, along with the linked URLs and corresponding text displayed when resting the mouse pointer on these areas, are defined in the ImageMap Editor.  
There are two different types of ImageMaps.  
A Client Site ImageMap is analyzed on the destination computer, which loaded the graphic from the Internet, while Server Site ImageMap is analyzed on the computer which provides the HTML page in the Internet.  
In server analysis, clicking an ImageMap sends the position of the cursor within the picture or frame in relative coordinates to the server, and an extra program on the server must react accordingly.  
In the "modern" client evaluation, clicking a defined "Hot Spot" of the ImageMap activates the linked URL, as if it were a normal text link.  
The URL appears below the mouse pointer when passing across the ImageMap.  
Their various uses make it obvious that ImageMaps can be stored in many different formats.  
ImageMap Formats  
ImageMaps are basically divided between those that are analyzed on the server (i. e. your Internet provider) and those analyzed on the web browser of the reader's computer.  
Server Site ImageMaps  
Server Site ImageMaps appear for the reader as a picture or frame on the page.  
Click on the ImageMap with the mouse, and the coordinates of the relative position are sent to the server.  
Aided by an extra program, the server then determines the next step to take.  
There are several incompatible methods to define this process, the two most common being:  
W3C (CERN) HTTP Server (Format type:  
MAP - CERN)  
NCSA HTTP Server (Format type:  
MAP - NCSA)  
%PRODUCTNAME creates ImageMaps for both methods.  
Select the format from the list under Files of type in the dialog ImageMap Save As.  
Separate Map Files are created which you must upload to the server.  
In any case, you will need to ask your provider or network administrator which type of ImageMaps are supported by the server and how to access the analysis program.  
Client Site ImageMap  
Modern Client Site ImageMaps do not present as much difficulty on the server side.  
The area of the picture or frame in which the reader can click on is indicated by the appearance of the linked URL when the mouse passes over the area.  
The ImageMap is stored in a layer below the picture and contains information about the referenced regions.  
The only disadvantage of Client Site ImageMaps is, that older Web browsers cannot read them; a disadvantage that will, however, resolve itself in time.  
When saving the ImageMap, select the file type SIP - StarView ImageMap, to save the ImageMap directly in a format which can be applied to every active picture or frame in your document.  
However, if you just want to use the ImageMap on the current picture or text frame, you do not have to save it in any special format.  
After defining the regions, simply click Apply.  
Nothing more is necessary.  
Client Site ImageMaps saved in HTML format are inserted directly into the page in HTML code.  
Some common Web browsers can read the Client Site ImageMaps in pixels, as they are defined in the document.  
In %PRODUCTNAME, the sizing is based on the original size of the graphic and scaled in the Hit Test.  
Graphics with fixed sizes or with no size specified will be converted.  
With relatively-sized graphics, the original size is used.  
And while graphics with procentual sizing still cannot be managed correctly in some Web browsers, %PRODUCTNAME is able to present excellent results.  
Intranet  
Intranet refers to local networks in companies, which use TCP/IP for communication purposes and HTTP as its transmission record.  
An Intranet has an advantage over normal networks in that transmissions via Internet are unproblematic and the required software is not too expensive at the moment.  
IP Address  
This is a 32-bit address in the Internet, written with four numbers between 0 and 255.  
The four numbers are separated by dots, for example 123.234.56.78.  
Every user has such an Internet protocol (IP) address.  
The IP address is normally only assigned dynamically for the duration of the connection.  
Since this type of address is difficult to remember, you usually address Internet servers by name.  
The "name server" sees that the name is matched to the correct IP address.  
Java  
Java is a platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (http://www.sun.com) which is especially suited for use in the Internet.  
Web pages and applications programmed with Java can be used on all Java-capable platforms.  
Java programs are usually developed in a Java environment and then compiled to a "byte code".  
A .class file is created, which can then be inserted as a "Java Applet" into HTML pages.  
A Java-capable Web browsers can compile the Java code immediately after receipt without the user having to unpack the archive.  
The basic concept of Java consists of sending a more advanced level of instruction (e.g. "draw a line") to the Web browser which then knows how to execute the instruction on the client computer.  
Thus a Java program can run on any computer which has a Java interpreter or compiler, for example, a Java-capable Web browser, independent of processor type and operating system.  
People often confuse JavaScript and Java Applets.  
JavaScript is a simple, limited script language for Web browsers used, for example, to display animated text.  
JavaScript describes objects in a Java-like language and lets users optically enhance their HTML pages without having to learn the entire Java language.  
Java Applets, on the other hand, are "proper" programs in "byte code" as described above.  
Plug-In  
Extensions providing additional functionality in Web Browsers are referred to as Plug-Ins.  
More about Plug-Ins.  
Plug-Ins (detailed explanation)  
Plug-In is a term used in various contexts:  
Plug-Ins in %PRODUCTNAME  
You will notice in %PRODUCTNAME that the Object bar and the contents of the format menus change after certain operations.  
If you insert a diagram in your text document, for example, you'll see icons and commands for editing the diagram, in fact the same ones as for diagram documents.  
In this sense, we refer to the diagram document as a Plug-In within the text document.  
This mechanism is even clearer if you insert a presentation document in a text document using Insert - Object - Plug-In.  
In the document window of your presentation document you'll see a text document and different toolbars.  
Using Plug-Ins to extend your programs  
Plug-Ins, generally speaking, are software additions to particular applications which provide enhanced functionality.  
Often import and export filters for various file formats are stored as Plug-Ins in a Plug-In directory.  
Netscape web browser extensions produced by Netscape Communication Corporation are also called Plug-Ins.  
These Plug-Ins can be linked to %PRODUCTNAME documents.  
%PRODUCTNAME supports 32-bit Plug-Ins that can run under Netscape.  
The 32-bit plug-ins, which you have already installed in a version of Netscape already existing in your system, will be automatically recognized by %PRODUCTNAME from the registration data and offered in the file-open-dialog under File type.  
If you want to install 32-bit plug-ins directly in %PRODUCTNAME, then this is possible with most plug-in installation programs.  
Enter as the destination the {installpath}/share/plugin folder that you may have created and logged into under Tools - Options... - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths.  
Some plug-ins, however, require Netscape to be installed before they can be installed.  
Proxy  
A proxy is a computer in the network acting as a kind of clipboard for data transfer.  
Whenever you access the Internet from a company network and request a Web page that has already been read by a colleague, the proxy will be able to display these much quicker as long as it's still in the memory.  
All that has to be checked in this case is that the page stored in the proxy is the latest version.  
If this is the case, the page won't have to be downloaded from the much slower Internet but can be loaded directly from the proxy.  
Server  
In networks, a server is a computer which provides other computers with data and programs etc.  
Servers exist, for example, as file servers in local networks, as Internet servers or as special FTP, mail and news servers.  
Moreover, an application that provides data for other programs (Clients) is called an (application) server.  
The %PRODUCTNAME Application Server is a program that runs on a network server and supplies data to the %PRODUCTNAME Remote Clients on workstations.  
SGML  
SGML stands for "Standard Generalized Markup Language".  
This does not depend on the later appearance of documents.  
A certain paragraph for example, will be coded as a title of the first order which is followed by a paragraph with the Bodytext coding.  
SGML also defines how non-text information, such as videos or readings, is to be inserted in the text.  
In structured texts, SGML not only defines structures (in the DTD = Document Type Definition) but also ensures they are consistently used.  
HTML is a specialized application of SGML.  
This means that most Web browsers support only a limited range of SGML standards and that almost all SGML-enabled systems can produce attractive HTML pages.  
The first line of a HTML document invariably contains a SGML instruction that defines all following lines as belonging to a HTML subset.  
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">  
SMTP/POP3  
SMTP and POP3 are two widely-used protocols for transmitting e-mail.  
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the usual protocol used by a modem or ISDN connection to communicate with your Internet provider's mail server to send and receive e-mail.  
POP3 (Post Office Protocol, Version 3) is a protocol used by your computer to get e-mail from the Internet provider's mail server.  
Style Sheets (CSS1/CSS2)  
Style sheets are new features of HTML 3 formats for Web documents.  
You can find the latest on style sheets at http://www.w3.org/Style/Activity.  
Style sheets aid in transferring the original formatting in your %PRODUCTNAME documents to HTML documents, and generally provide better results than the normal HTML format tags.  
Information is listed in the style sheets for effects such as fonts, font sizes, and line spacing.  
The list is in HTML code between the new tags<style> and </style> in the form of a long comment.  
The tags are ignored by Web browsers that cannot yet handle style sheets.  
More about Styles.  
Styles (extended explanation)  
In addition to this kind of embedded style sheet, you can use your own style sheet files which are referenced by HTML documents.  
This allows you to make style changes to just one file that then affect all documents.  
The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are style sheets which build on one another.  
The style sheets, hierarchically arranged under a defined head style sheet, "inherit" all properties of the style sheet above them, and then include some additional attributes.  
Netscape Navigator 4 recognizes the CSS extension Dynamic HTML which makes it possible to layer objects on a page in three dimensions.  
Dynamic HTML offers relative and absolute positioning of page elements and visibility as a new property.  
A detailed description can be found under http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-positioning.  
Search Engines  
A search engine is a service in the Internet based on a software program used to explore the vast amount of information using key words.  
Tags  
HTML pages written in 7-bit ASCII text contain certain structural and formatting instructions called tags.  
Tags are code words enclosed by brackets in the document description language HTML.  
Many tags contain text or hyperlink references between the opening and closing brackets.  
For example, titles are marked by the tags<h1> at the beginning and </h1> at the end of the title.  
Some tags only appear on their own such as<br> for a line break or <img ...> to link a graphic.  
TCP/IP  
This abbreviation stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.  
TCP is responsible for making and breaking the connections between all computers in a network.  
It controls the data flow in the net and ensures data transfers are complete.  
IP is responsible for organizing and addressing data.  
Prior to transfer, the data is divided into packets which are then rejoined on the remote computer.  
This protocol is used both in local networks and in the Internet.  
URL  
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) displays the address of a document or a server in the Internet.  
The general structure of a URL varies according to type and is generally in the form Service://Hostname:Port/Path/Page#Mark although not all elements are always required.  
An URL can be a FTP address, a WWW (HTTP) address, a file address or an e-mail address.  
Web Server  
A Web server is a computer linked to the Internet with a program suitable for displaying WWW documents and preparing these for downloading.  
XML  
The "Extensible Markup Language" is a language standard for documents developed under the direction of Sun Microsystems.  
The development objectives for XML included unproblematic use of XML documents in the Internet, support for a broad range of applications and compatibility with SGML.  
A detailed description of XML can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml; you will find a FAQ list at http://www.ucc.ie/xml /.

Terminology Made Easy - General Glossary  
In order to make your start with %PRODUCTNAME easier, this glossary includes explanations of some of the most important terms you will come across.  
As a newcomer in working with %PRODUCTNAME applications, you will probably be confronted with many unfamiliar terms:  
But don't worry, with the aid of the glossary you'll find out everything you need to know.  
Click on one of the following terms or search the glossary to find the term you are looking for.  
Floating toolbar, Adabas, ADO, Dock, ASCII, Bézier object, Bit, Bitmap, Curve measure, dBase, DDE, Spin button, Formatting (direct and indirect), Graphic, JDBC, Kerning, Context menu, Units of measure (Metric), Metafile, Native driver, Object, ODBC, OLAP, OLE, OpenGL, PNG, Primary key, Relational database, Register-true, RTF, Widows and orphans, Select, Save, relative and absolute, SQL, SQL Server Database, %PRODUCTNAME API, Task, TWAIN, Unicode, Link, Numerical system.  
Adabas  
Adabas D, Version 11, is a database format for %PRODUCTNAME databases under Windows, Linux and Solaris Sparc.  
More information about Adabas, further Help files and purchasing higher versions can be found on the producer's homepage at: http://www.adabas.com.  
ADO  
Docking  
Some windows in %PRODUCTNAME are dockable windows, e.g. the Stylist, the Navigator and the Gallery.  
On each edge you can dock several windows on top of or alongside each other; then, by moving the border lines, you can change the relative proportions of the window.  
To undock and re-dock, double-click in the window while pressing Command Ctrl.  
Double-click a vacant area of the window; in the Stylist double-click a gray part of the window, e.g. next to the icons.  
Refer to the Operating Tips for more details on working with dockable windows.  
Docking (Detailed Operating Tips)  
On any window edge where another window is docked you will see two buttons which allow you to show, hide or fix the window.  
If you use the arrow button on the window edge to show the other window, the window will remain visible until you manually hide it again (with the same button).  
If you show the window by clicking the window border, you activate the AutoHide function.  
Hiding is then automatic.  
Seize a window by the title bar or by a vacant area and move it across the screen.  
Hold down the (Command) (Ctrl) key while moving it to dock the window to the edges.  
If you want to dock another window to one which is already docked, you can have them one on top of the other or side by side.  
Note the change in the window edge.  
This shows you where the window will dock and how big it will be.  
If a window is docked, you can turn it back into a floating window by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) and double-clicking in a vacant area.  
ASCII  
Abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  
ASCII is a character set for displaying fonts on personal computers.  
It consists of 128 characters including letters, numbers, punctuation and symbols.  
The extended ASCII character set contains 256 characters.  
Each character has been assigned a unique number, also referred to as ASCII Code.  
In HTML pages, only characters from the 7 Bit ASCII character set should appear.  
Other characters, such as German umlauts, are distinguished by way of a separate code.  
For example, a small case "ü" becomes "ü".  
The %PRODUCTNAME export filter performs the necessary conversion automatically.  
Bézier Object  
Bézier curves.  
These objects can be modified by mouse click on the curve points or control points.  
Bit  
'Bit' is an abbreviation of the words' binary 'and' digit '.  
A bit is thus the smallest unit of information in the binary system.  
In data processing, a byte is composed of 8 bits.  
Bitmap  
A bitmap basically means a pattern of "bits".  
In general, when people refer to bitmaps, they mean a raster graphic or pixel graphic.  
This kind of graphic is dissolved into single points that can be controlled independently of each other.  
Common bitmap file formats are BMP, GIF and JPEG.  
curve measuring  
An angle is the directional difference between two lines.  
In general, an angle represents a part of a circle (equal to 360 degrees)  
When determinating angles in radiants, an arc of the "Unit circle" is assigned to a given angle alpha (measurement unit radiant is mostly ommitted).  
The Unit circle is a circle with a radius of r=1.  
3.14159265) This means:  
1 degree correpsonds 2*Pi/360 = Pi/180  
Radiants = Degrees *(Pi/180)  
Degrees = radiants * (180/Pi)  
Note that the trigonometric functions are calculated in radiants.  
As 1*Pi corresponds to 180 degrees, a given degree value has to be multiplied with Pi/180 in order to be converted in radiants.  
To convert radiants in degrees, it has to be multiplied with 180/Pi correspondingly.  
dBase  
Abbreviation for Data Base, a common database and file format.  
DDE  
DDE stands for "Dynamic Data Exchange," which is more or less a predecessor of OLE, "Object Linking and Embedding".  
With DDE, objects are linked via file reference, but not embedded.  
You can create an DDE link if you proceed in the following way:  
Select cells from a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet, copy them into the clipboard and switch to another spreadhsheet and select the Edit - Paste Special dialog.  
There use the Link option to insert the contents as a DDE link.  
When activating a link, the inserted cell area will be read from its original file.  
formatting  
Formatting here refers to the visual layout of text using a word-processing or DTP program.  
Among other things, this includes defining the paper format, page borders, fonts and font effects, as well as indents and spacing.  
Since manually formatting long texts is time-consuming and complicated, %PRODUCTNAME provides special Styles.  
With the aid of these Styles, you can format documents much faster.  
Further information about formatting directly or with Styles.  
Direct and Style Formatting  
If you format a document without Styles, it is referred to as "direct" formatting.  
This means modifying text or other objects, such as frames or tables, by applying various attributes directly.  
The format applies only to the selected area and all changes must be made separately.  
Styles, on the other hand, are not applied to the text directly, but rather are defined in the Stylist and then applied.  
One advantage is that when you change a Style, all parts of the document to which that Style is assigned are modified at the same time.  
You can remove direct formatting from your document by selecting the entire text with the shortcut keys Command Ctrl +A and then choosing Format - Default.  
Graphics, Vector Graphics and Pixel Graphics  
In the field of computing, one distinguishes between vector graphics and pixel graphics.  
Vector graphics consist of instructions such "draw a line having line weight A and color B from the point having coordinates (C, D) to point (E, F)".  
Vector graphics of this kind are not resolution-dependent, i.e. they look equally good regardless of the zoom (within certain limitations relating to the print medium).  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you can create vector graphics via the File - New - Presentation or the Drawing menu command.  
Pixel graphics consist of pixels, i.e. small dots, which are arranged in rows and columns and are of different colors.  
800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high; one pixel is the smallest possible unit.  
Problems arise if one enlarges pixel graphics, e.g. to 1000 x 800.  
One cannot simply enlarge each pixel, as the pixels are of a specific size, which is determined by the print medium.  
Therefore some of the pixels have to be doubled, while others are not doubled, and intermediate colors (if any) have to be calculated.  
This tends to impair reproduction quality.  
Nevertheless, pixel graphics are widely used, as cameras, scanners and similar devices generate pixel graphics.  
Software for retouching pixel graphics is widely available; the quality and price of the software tends to vary.  
You can generate pixel graphics in %PRODUCTNAME Draw with the File - Export command and selection of a corresponding file format such as JPG.  
JDBC  
JDBC stands for Java DataBase Connectivity and is just as ODBC a protocol for accessing database systems.  
The only difference is the platform-indepency of the JDBC driver(s) programmed in Java in opposite to the platform dependent ODBC drivers (mostly programmed in C(++)).  
kerning  
Kerning means increasing or decreasing the amount of space between pairs of letters to improve the overall appearance of the text, for example, between W and a.  
The kerning tables contain information on which pairs of letters must be closed-up or spaced-out.  
These tables are generally a component of a font.  
Metafile  
The Windows Metafile Format (WMF) is a graphic format that has been developed for Microsoft Windows.  
WMF graphic files can contain both bitmaps and vector data.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress the metafile format is used as the vector format.  
Native Driver  
%PRODUCTNAME contains so-called native drivers for special database systems.  
With the help of a native driver, you have direct access to the database client in question.  
Object  
An object is a screen element containing data.  
It can refer to application data, such as text or graphics.  
Objects are independent and do not influence each other.  
Any object containing data can be assigned certain commands.  
For example, a graphic object has commands for image editing and a spreadsheet contains calculation commands.  
ODBC  
This abbreviation stands for Open DataBase Connectivity, and is a protocol norm with which applications can access database systems.  
The query language used here is SQL (Structured Query Language).  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you can determine for each database whether to use SQL commands to run queries.  
Alternatively, use the interactive help to define your query via mouseclick and have it automatically translated into SQL by %PRODUCTNAME.  
The 32bit ODBC functions required here can be installed on your system at any time with the help of the setup program supplied with your database.  
You can then amend the properties via the Control Panel.  
OLAP  
OLAP is the abbreviation for O n l ine A nalytical P rocessing.  
These are special software programs for data analyzing in databases.  
OLAP software enables the user to analyze different dimensions of multi-dimensional data structures, e.g. with trend analysis.  
The main component of OLAP is the OLAP server which is located between the client and the database management system (DBMS).  
The OLAP server understands how the data has been organized in the database and it has special functions for analyzing this data.  
There are OLAP servers available for almost all known database systems.  
OLE  
Abbreviation for Object Linking and Embedding.  
Objects can be linked to a target document or may also be embedded.  
Embedding inserts a copy of the object and details of the source program in the target document.  
If you want to edit the object, simply activate the source program by double-clicking on the object.  
OpenGL  
OpenGL represents a 3D graphics language, initially developed by SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc).  
Two dialects of this language are commonly used:  
Microsoft OpenGL, developed for the use in Windows NT, and Cosmo OpenGL made by SGI.  
The latter represents an independent graphics language for all platforms and all kind of computers, even usable on machines without special 3-D graphics hardware.  
PNG  
PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics.  
A graphic file format, more and more used in the Internet.  
The files are compressed with a selectable compression factor, and, in opposite to the JPG format, PNG files are always compressed without any information loss.  
PNG can save 24 and 8 Bit Color, grey scale and black&white pictures, if desired provided with alpha channels that can be used for transparency attributes.  
The rest of the picture will then be loaded subsequently.  
Primary key  
A primary key serves as a unique identifier of database fields.  
The unique identification of database fields is used in relational databases, to access data in other tables.  
If reference is made to a primary key from another table, this is termed a foreign key  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you define the primary key in the draft view of a table, by choosing the relevant command from the context menu of a row header for the selected field.  
Relational Database  
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) represents a system of related tables databases.  
Provided that the database is propperly designed, you only have to enter data once although you can view them in different relations.  
A good example of a relational database can be given with a purchasing database where the Customer, Purchase, and Invoice tables are contained.  
In the invoice table, no customers or purchasing data but the references (via a relational link, a relation) to the respective table's field (e.g., the customer ID field from the customer table) are contained.  
Register-true  
Register-true is a typography term used in printing.  
It refers to the congruent imprint of the lines within a type area on the front and back side of books, newspapers and magazines.  
This prevents a gray smudge from forming between the lines, making reading easier.  
Register-true lines refers to when all adjacent rows in text columns are at the same height.  
When you define paragraphs, pages or Paragraph and Page Styles as register-true, the base line will be aligned to correspond with the vertical line grid of each Paragraph Style defined as a reference Style.  
You can now insert, for example, paragraphs with other font sizes or graphics in multi-column pages between the register-true defined paragraphs, and the base line of the rows next to each other in all register-true paragraphs remain aligned at the same height.  
RTF  
Abbreviation for Rich Text Format, a file format developed for the exchange of text files.  
A special feature is that the formatting is converted into directly readable text information.  
Widows and Orphans  
Widows and orphans are historical typography terms, which have been in use for many years.  
A widow refers to a short line at the end of a paragraph, which when printed, appears alone at the top of the next page.  
An orphan is, in contrast, the first line of a paragraph printed alone at the bottom of the previous page.  
In a %PRODUCTNAME text document you can automatically prevent such occurrences in the desired Paragraph Style.  
When doing so, you can determine the minimum amount of lines to be kept together on a page.  
Selecting  
Many %PRODUCTNAME commands refer to the selection, e.g. when formatting text in %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
To select text with the mouse, press the left mouse button and move the pointer over the text.  
The selected text appears highlighted.  
saving, relative und absolute  
In various dialogs (e.g.  
Edit - AutoText) you can select if you want to save the files relatively or absolutely.  
Your response should be dependent upon the intended purpose of your document.  
Further information about saving relatively and absolutely.  
Saving Relatively and Absolutely  
If you choose to save relatively, the references to embedded graphics or other objects in your document will be saved relative to this location in the file system.  
In this case, it doesn't matter if the referenced directory structure is recorded on drive C: or drive D: respectively on Volume HD1 or HD2 or wherever.  
The files will be found regardless (as long as the reference remains on the same drive or volume).  
This is especially important if you create a directory structure on an Internet server, such as in a personal homepage with your Internet provider.  
If you prefer absolute saving, all references to other files will also be defined as absolute, i.e., based on the respective drive, volume or root directory.  
The advantage is that the document containing the references can be moved to other directories or folders, and the references remain valid.  
On the other hand, for documents you want to make available to other computers, which may have a completely different directory structure, drive or volume names, it would make sense to save the references as relatives rather than as absolutes.  
SQL  
"Structured Query Language" is a language used for database queries.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can formulate queries either in SQL or interactively with the mouse.  
SQL Database / SQL Server  
An SQL database is a database system which offers an SQL interface.  
SQL databases are often used in client/server networks in which different clients access a central server (e.g. an SQL server), hence they are also called SQL server databases, or SQL servers for short.  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you can integrate external SQL databases.  
These may be located on your local hard disk as well as on the network.  
Access is achieved either via ODBC or via a Native Driver integrated into %PRODUCTNAME.  
%PRODUCTNAME API  
The %PRODUCTNAME API (Application Program Interface) is the interface for programming %PRODUCTNAME.  
This guarantees program-controlled access to all %PRODUCTNAME components and allows you to develop customized modules. %PRODUCTNAME API can be reached either through Java or by using the Component Object Model from.  
Task  
A task represents a limited part of the functions and activities in a program.  
Seen from the perspective of the operating system, each running program represents a task, from the perspective of %PRODUCTNAME, all documents are tasks. "Task" may also be used in an event planner in the every-day sense of the word, i.e. to do's.  
TWAIN  
TWAIN represents a standard software protocol and application programming interface (API) for the communication between devices that process pictures, e.g. scanners and digital cameras, and software.  
Presently, the TWAIN protocol is only supported in the Windows versions.  
On UNIX platforms, %PRODUCTNAME is supporting the SANE standard, see http://www.mostang.com/sane /.  
Unicode  
Unicode is a system which can handle the characters and elements from every known font system and character system.  
Each character or element is expressed as a two-byte-long number.  
Together with the UTF 16 extension this means over one million characters can be reproduced.  
Individual character sets with relatively narrow constraints are therefore a thing of the past.  
Different languages can be mixed without any difficulty.  
For detailed information, please see the Unicode Consortium homepage at http://www.unicode.org.  
Link  
In the Edit menu, you'll find the command Links This can only be activated when at least one link is contained in the current document.  
When you insert an object such as a graphic, for example, you can either copy it directly into the document or insert as a link.  
When an object is copied directly into a document, the document size increases by (at least) the size in bytes of the object.  
You can save the document and open it on another computer, and the inserted object will still be in the same position in the document.  
If you insert the object as a link, only a reference to the file name is inserted.  
The file size of the document increases only by the path and file reference.  
If you open your document on another computer, however, the linked file must be in exactly the same position as given by the reference in order to view the object in the document.  
Use the Edit Links dialog to see which files are linked to your document.  
The links can be removed if required.  
Number System  
A number system is determined by the number of characters available for representing numbers.  
The decimal system, for instance is based on the numbers (0..9), the binary numbers are based on the numbers 0 and 1, the hexadecimal system is based on 16 character (0...9 and A...F).  
Toolbars  
Icon on the Main Toolbar:  
Icon on the Text Object Bar:  
Icon on the Object Bar:  
Icon on the Object Bar in the Slide View:  
Please note that this display refers to the default display at the time of installation. %PRODUCTNAME lets you easily modify the menus, icons and toolbars.  
When you make changes, however, your configuration differs from that described here.  
Asian-specific Functionality  
These commands can only be accessed after you enable the support of Asian languages under Tools - Options - Language Settings - Languages.  
Context Menus  
Cut  
Cuts out the selected object and stores it on the clipboard.  
The object can be reinserted from there by using Paste.  
Paste  
Inserts the element you moved to the clipboard using Copy.  
This command can only be called if the contents of the clipboard can be inserted at the current cursor position.  
Insert  
Opens a submenu in the Gallery where you can choose between Copy and Link.  
The selected graphic object is either copied into the current document or a link is created depending on your choice.  
If you have selected an object in your document, e.g. the object last insert, then a new insertion will replace the selected object.  
Background  
Inserts the selected picture as a background graphic.  
Use the submenu points Page and Paragraph to define whether the graphic should cover the entire page or only the current paragraph.  
Copy  
Copies the selected element to the clipboard.  
Delete  
Deletes the current selection.  
If multiple objects are selected, all will be deleted.  
In most cases, a security query appears before objects are deleted.  
The object is either physically deleted from the data carrier or the object display is removed, depending on context.  
If you choose Delete while in the Gallery, the entry will be deleted from the Gallery, but the file itself will remain untouched.  
Query  
Opens a submenu, where you choose to create the query in either the Autopilot or the Query Design mode.  
Form  
Opens a dialog where you can select a form type.  
Table  
Opens a submenu to decide if the table is created in the design mode or using an AutoPilot.  
Table View  
For example, if this table is addressed via a database server.  
Open  
Use this command to open the selected object in a new task.  
%PRODUCTNAME Database (Name: [Short name])  
Define here if the database will be registered using a short name or not.  
If the database has been registered, a tick mark will be assigned to this command.  
You will find more information in the %PRODUCTNAME Help under the key word Database Names.  
Rename  
Enables a selected object to be renamed.  
After selecting Rename the name is selected and a new one can be entered direcdtly.  
Use the arrow keys to set the cursor at the beginning or end of the name to delete or add to part of the name or to reposition the cursor.  
Update  
Click this entry to refresh the view in this window or refresh the selected object.  
Preview  
The element selected is displayed in the Gallery at maximum size.  
Double-click the preview to switch back to the normal Gallery view.  
Create Link  
This command can be activated if an object is marked.  
A link named "Link to xxx" (xxx represents the name of the object) will be created directly in the same directory the object is in.  
Menu Commands  
The commands, which can be used for editing, viewing, sequencing, formatting and printing, etc. a document or its contents, can only be called up if the document is open and acitve.  
Active means, in this case, that the document has to be in front of any others on the screen.  
If you want the commands to correspond to an object in the document, then that object has to be selected.  
The menus are context sensitive, this means that those menu commands will be available that are relevant to the work being currently carried out.  
If, for example, you have selected graphics in a document, then you will see all of the menu commands that can be used to edit graphics.  
You now see only the menu entries that can also be started.  
The other inactive menu items are hidden.  
If you choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - View you can mark the Inactive Menu Entries field if you wish to see the inactive menu entries as gray entries.  
about import and export filters  
In %PRODUCTNAME, apart from its own XML formats you can also open and write in many foreign formats.  
In UNIX, certain file formats cannot be recognized automatically. %PRODUCTNAME normally recognizes the correct file type automatically on opening a file.  
There may be cases where you have to select the file type yourself in the Open dialog.  
Suppose you have a database table in text format, which you also want to open as a database table.  
In this case you would not only select the file, but also specify the file type "Text CVS".  
Only then does the dialog to Import text of a database table open.  
There, for example, you can select the option US English, so that an attempt will be made to interpret the content as US-English-formatted numbers, regardless of the system language.  
The English names of the months are automatically recognized.  
Basic Macros in MS Office Documents  
In Tools - Options - Load/Save - VBA Properties you can specify what should happen to VBA macro codes in MS Office documents.  
VBA macros are unable to run in %PRODUCTNAME; they must first be converted and adapted.  
Often you only want to use %PRODUCTNAME to change the visible content of a Word, Excel or PowerPoint file and then save the file again in Microsoft Office format without changing the macros they contain.  
You can set the behavior of %PRODUCTNAME as desired.  
Either the VBA macros are saved to the clipboard in commented form as a subroutine of %PRODUCTNAME and when the document is saved in MS Office format are written back correctly again, or you can select the %PRODUCTNAME macros to be removed when loading.  
The last option is of course a more effective protection against viruses within the Microsoft Office documents.  
Notes regarding %PRODUCTNAME -specific formats  
In %PRODUCTNAME Writer version 5.0 and higher, far larger text documents can be loaded and saved than in earlier versions.  
Therefore, an attempt to save a very large text document in an older %PRODUCTNAME Writer format may lead to an error message.  
Notes regarding external formats and file types  
Even if they are not installed, some filters can be selected in the Open and Save dialogs.  
If you select such a filter, a message will appear saying that you can still install the filter if you require.  
If you want to install additional filters or remove individual filters from the installation, close %PRODUCTNAME, start the %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION Setup program and select the Modify option.  
Then you will see a dialog in which you can add or remove individual components of %PRODUCTNAME.  
Graphic filters can be found in "Optional Components".  
Importing and Exporting Text Documents  
You also can save your own texts in Word format.  
However, not everything available with %PRODUCTNAME Writer can be transferred to MS Word, and not everything can be imported.  
Only the first outline per area in a Page Style is retained when %PRODUCTNAME Writer outlines are exported to Word format, since Word cannot process additional levels.  
All additional outlines will have the same layout as the first.  
Word also cannot use graphics as bullets.  
This applies to characters after and before numbers.  
Importing is normally not problematic.  
This information can also be given different coloring for each author.  
Furthermore, information about the time of such changes is also included.  
However, some of the attributes may be lost during the import procedure.  
It is also possible to import and export RTF files.  
This file format can be used to exchange formatted texts across various applications and platforms.  
In this way, may formats read by most programs will be transferred without a problem.  
The clipboard uses RTF format when you insert part of a spreadsheet from %PRODUCTNAME Calc via DDE into %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
The text filter in Encoded Text helps you open and save text documents with another Encoding font.  
The filter contains a dialog that enables you to define fonts, default fonts, language and paragraph break.  
Importing and Exporting in HTML Format  
When borders in HTML documents are exported, e.g. a paragraph border, lines are exported in a width of exactly 1 pixel since Netscape Navigator and MS Internet Explorer do not recognize smaller lines.  
When importing, a border that is normally 1 pixel wide will appear to be only 0.05 pt wide.  
With %PRODUCTNAME Writer, you can insert footnotes and endnotes in your HTML document.  
The footnote and endnote characters are exported as hyperlinks.  
Notes are used to include unknown characters in an HTML document.  
Every note that begins with "HTML:..." and ends with ">" is treated as an HTML code, but is exported without these designations.  
Several tags around text can be included after "HTML:..." Accented characters are converted into the ANSI character set.  
Notes are created during import (e.g. for meta tags that have no room in the document information or unknown tags).  
UCS2 character coding.  
Here all characters are shown that are contained in the ANSI character set or in the system's character set.  
When exporting to HTML, the character set selected in Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility is used.  
Characters not present there are written in the substitute form "&#1234;", which will be displayed correctly in modern web browsers.  
When exporting such characters, you will receive an appropriate warning.  
If, in Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility, you select Netscape Navigator 4.0, MS Internet Explorer 4.0 or %PRODUCTNAME Writer as the export option, upon export all important font attributes are exported as direct attributes (e.g. text color, font size, bold, italic etc.) in CSS1 styles. (CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
Style Sheets can be compiled as styles or print formats.) Importing is also carried out according to this standard.  
The "font" property corresponds to Netscape Navigator, i.e. font style (italic, none), font-variant (normal, small caps) and font-weight (normal, bold).  
If one of the values is not indicated, it is ignored.  
E.g. font: bold italic small caps 12pt/200% Arial, Helvetica switches to bold, italic, small caps, double-space with the font family Arial or Helvetica, if Arial doesn't exist.  
10pt switches to a 10pt font, with bold, italic, small caps off.  
If MS Internet Explorer 4.0 or %PRODUCTNAME Writer are set as the export option, the sizes of the control field and their internal margins are exported as styles (print formats).  
CSS1 size properties are based on "width" and "height" values.  
To allow different distances, the "Margin-Left", "Margin-Right", "Margin-Top" and "Margin-Bottom" properties are used.  
The distances of graphics, Plug-Ins and Applets to the content can be set individually for %PRODUCTNAME Writer and MS Internet Explorer 4.0.  
If the top/bottom or right/left margin is set differently, the distances are exported in a "STYLE" option for the corresponding tag as CSS1 size properties "Margin-Top", "Margin-Bottom", "Margin-Left" and "Margin-Right".  
Text frames are supported with the use of CSS1 extensions for absolute positioned objects.  
This applies only to the export browsers Netscape Navigator 4.0, MS Internet Explorer 4.0 and %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
Text frames can be aligned as graphics, Plug-Ins, Applets and Floating Frames, but character-linked frames are not possible.  
Text frames are exported as "<SPAN> "or "<DIV>" tags if they do not contain columns.  
If they do contain columns then they are exported as "<MULTICOL> ".  
The unit for CSS1 properties set in %PRODUCTNAME is used for HTML Export.  
The unit can be set separately for text and HTML documents under Tools - Options - Text Document - General or Tools - Options - HTML Document - View.  
The number of exported decimal places depends on the unit.  
Measurement Unit  
Measurement Unit Name in CSS1  
Maximum Number of Decimal Places  
Millimeter

The %PRODUCTNAME web page filter supports certain capabilities of CSS2.  
However, to use it, print layout export must be activated in Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility.  
Then, in HTML documents, besides the HTML Page Style, you can also use the styles "First page", "Left page" and "Right page".  
These styles should enable you to set different page sizes and margins for the first page and for right and left pages when printing.  
Importing and Exporting Numbering  
If, in Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility, the export option "%PRODUCTNAME Writer" or "Internet Explorer" is selected, the indents of numberings are exported as "margin-left"-CSS1-Property in the STYLE attribute of the<OL> and <UL> tags.  
The property indicates the difference relative to the indent of the next higher level.  
A left paragraph indent in numbering is indicated as "margin-left"-CSS1-Property.  
First-line indents are ignored in numbering and not exported.  
Importing and Exporting Spreadsheet Files  
The whole formula can be viewed during the export process and the deleted reference contains an indication (#REF!) to the reference.  
A #REF! will be correspondingly created for the reference during the import.  
Importing and Exporting Graphics Files  
As in HTML documents, you can choose to use a filter with or without the element (%PRODUCTNAME Impress) in the name to open a %PRODUCTNAME graphics file.  
Otherwise, the file saved by an old program version is now opened in %PRODUCTNAME Impress, so that, for example, you can use the document as the starting point for a presentation.  
EPS graphics are imported and displayed in a preview.  
If a different printer is used the preview will be printed.  
When exporting EPS graphics a preview is created and has the TIFF format.  
If an EPS graphic is exported together other graphics in the EPS format then this file will be embedded unchanged in the new file.  
Multipage-TIFFs are activated when graphics are imported or exported in TIFF format.  
The graphics are retrieved as a set of individual pictures in a single file, e.g. the individual pages of a fax.  
Some %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress options can be accessed via File - Export.  
PostScript  
To export a document or graphic in PostScript format do the following:  
If you have not yet done so, install a PostScript printer driver, such as the Apple LaserWriter driver.  
Select the PostScript printer in the dialog and mark the Print to file check box.  
A PostScript file will be created.  
XML File Formats  
%PRODUCTNAME uses an XML file format as the default for saving and opening its documents.  
XML file format names  
If in the dialogs for saving and opening %PRODUCTNAME documents you do not select any other file type, %PRODUCTNAME uses the following XML formats:  
Application  
File extension  
%PRODUCTNAME Writer  
*. sxw  
%PRODUCTNAME Writer templates  
*.stw  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc  
*.sxc  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc templates  
*.stc  
%PRODUCTNAME Impress  
*.sxi  
%PRODUCTNAME Impress templates  
*.sti  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw  
*.sxd  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw templates  
*.std  
%PRODUCTNAME Math  
*.sxm  
Master documents  
*.sxg  
These file name extensions on the one hand allow better differentiation if you are searching though a lot of files of different file types in a directory.  
And on the other, from the name, it is clear that compressed XML files are involved that must first be unpacked before being read, for example, by a text editor.  
If you want to work permanently with another file format, you can define that format as the default.  
Choose Tools - Options - Load/Save - General to find alternative file formats that can be selected for each %PRODUCTNAME document type.  
XML file structure  
The %PRODUCTNAME XML file formats are compressed according to the ZIP method.  
Use an unpacking program of your choice to unpack the content of an XML file with your subdirectories.  
You see a structure similar to the following illustration.  
The text content of the document is located in content.xml.  
You can view this file with, for example, a pure text editor.  
By default content.xml without indents is stored at the start of the line in order to minimize the time for saving and opening.  
By choosing Tools - Options - Load/Save - General you can change this procedure so that the lines are saved with a structured indent.  
meta.xml contains, inter alia, the meta information on the document, which you can enter under File - Properties.  
If you save a document with security, only meta.xml is not secured.  
settings.xml contains further information on settings for this document, for example on the printer, on the recording of changes, the associated data sources and so on.  
In styles.xml you find the Styles defined for the document that can, for example, be seen in the Stylist.  
The meta-inf/manifest.xml file describes the structure of the XML file.  
Additional files can be contained in the packed file format.  
Illustrations are, for example, contained in a Pictures subdirectory, Basic code in a Basic subdirectory and linked Basic libraries are found in further subdirectories of Basic.  
Definition of the XML formats  
The DTD (Document Type Description) files can be found in {installpath}/share/dtd {installpath}\share\dtd.  
Note that the formats are subject to certain licenses.  
You can find notes on the licenses at the start of the DTD files.  
More detailed information can be found on the OpenOffice.org website.  
The %PRODUCTNAME installation is incomplete.  
If this dialog was displayed automatically, it was determined at %PRODUCTNAME startup that important files are missing or incorrectly registered in the system, and it was not possible to correct the error automatically.  
Try the following procedure to fix the problem  
Close %PRODUCTNAME and call the %PRODUCTNAME Setup program.  
Select the Repair Installation option.  
Missing components  
In this list, you can view the missing or incorrectly registered components.  
Always verify when %PRODUCTNAME starts up  
Deselect the option if no more testing occurs at %PRODUCTNAME startup.

If the window is docked to the left of the workplace, the following buttons appear depending on the state:  
Show  
A hidden window can be shown by clicking the arrow button.  
Hide  
Click the arrow button to hide a window.

Click this button to fix a floating window.  
Floating

If the data name is longer than the list field, only the beginning of the file name is displayed.  
Type:  
This field contains details about the current document file type.  
Location:  
Displays the location of the loaded document.  
Size:  
Displays the size of the current document in bytes.  
Created on:  
The date and time of the saving of the first document version is shown here.  
If you open a document in pure text format, %PRODUCTNAME creates a %PRODUCTNAME Writer text document from it and displays it on the screen.  
You can format in the same way as for %PRODUCTNAME Writer text documents as well as formatting that cannot be displayed in pure text files.  
This indicates that the document on the screen is already something more than (or something different from) the initial document, which may be present in pure ASCII code.  
So it should come as no surprise that the creation date displayed in the Properties dialog is "Now" - the document as it appears is in fact a new document!  
When you save the document you can decide whether to save it as a pure text document or as a %PRODUCTNAME Writer text document.  
Modified on:  
This area shows the date and time the document was last modified.

Options  
After clicking on this button you will see the Printer Options dialog.  
After clicking on this button you will see the Printer Options dialog.  
In terms of structure it corresponds to the Tools - Options - Text Document - Print register.  
This is where you set which information you do not wish to print out, how notes are to be treated during printing, which input slot is to be used, etc.  
The Printer Options dialog settings are valid for the current document only.  
To apply individual settings in this dialog to other documents in general, define them as global defaults in Tools - Options - Text Document - Print.  
This dialog corresponds in structure to a page of the Options dialog that you can reach by choosing Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - Print.  
Use the Options button to access the Printer Options dialog.  
The structure of this dialog is similar to the one under Tools - Options - Drawing - Print.  
Click Options to access the Printer Options dialog.  
This dialog is similar to a register from the Options dialog (Tools - Options - Drawing - Print).  
This dialog is similar to the Settings dialog under the Tools - Options - Formula.  
The settings defined in the latter dialog refer to all documents whereas, the Printer Options dialog lets you select settings for the current printout only.  
Under UNIX, the special characters 128 - 160 in Windows will appear in the printout.  
This makes it possible to take a document created in %PRODUCTNAME for Windows and possibly containing typographical characters, and print it on a PostScript printer under UNIX.  
Because the XServer does not recognize these special characters, it does not display them on screen; it only prints them.  
The FontMetric (character spacing) is exact for Monospaced fonts only; the spacing of other fonts is approximated.  
Through the environment variable STAR_SPOOL_DIR you can specify a directory where the spoolfiles of the Xprinter are saved under Unix.  
Example:  
setenv STAR_SPOOL_DIR /usr/local/tmp (in the csh/tcsh) or  
export STAR_SPOOL_DIR=/usr/local/tmp (in the sh/bash)  
In the spadmin printer setup program you can make these and further settings per dialog.  
Open the Connect dialog.  
The settings for the new queue can also be made as default.  
Printer Setup  
This command opens a dialog with printer information.  
You can switch printers if you have more than one printer installed, and you can select the printer setup dialog to define various print options.  
In the dialog, you can select the paper size and which printer tray is to be used, etc.  
When you change printer, all OLE-embedded %PRODUCTNAME objects in a document are notified if they are set up for notification (e.g. %PRODUCTNAME Math).  
Since notification may take some time because of additional loading time, a Status Bar appears with the "Adjust Objects" message.  
Printer  
Here you will find information relevant to your installed printer driver.  
Depending on the printer, you can define various settings.  
Name  
The name of the current printer is shown here.  
If you have already printed your document, the name of the most recently used printer appears in this field.  
If multiple printer drivers are installed on your computer, you can select one from the list.

Here you will see if the printer is ready for operation and whether or not it refers to the standard printer.  
Type  
This field displays the name of the printer driver in use.  
Location  
The printer connection is specified here.  
Comments  
If you or the printer manufacturer have entered a comment regarding the printer driver, it is shown here.  
Properties  
Click this button to open the Properties dialog for your printer driver.  
As this dialog comes from the printer manufacturer, its appearance may vary depending on the equipment in use.  
Note that the Landscape or Portrait page orientation set in the printer properties should correspond to the page format under Format - Page.  
You must in any case set up a default printer in your system, so that %PRODUCTNAME can display the documents on the screen in the way you want to see them printed.  
In Windows you can set up a default printer under Start - Settings - Control Panel - Printers.  
In Unix use the spadmin program to set a default printer for %PRODUCTNAME.  
Send  
This command opens a submenu containing various commands for sending your current document as an e-mail.  
You can transfer an outline to a %PRODUCTNAME Impress document or store it in the clipboard, or create an AutoAbstract, a master document or an HTML document.

sending documents as e-mails  
Use this command to send the current document as e-mail.  
The command starts your system's default e-mail program.  
The current document is already entered there as an e-mail attachment.  
Master Document Name and Path  
Here you create a master document out of a text document.  
For every chapter that begins with a Paragraph Style which you have selected, a new sub-document is automatically saved.  
After choosing the command, you see the dialog Name and Path of Master Document, where you enter a name and path for the master document to be created.  
The dialog has the same functions as the Save As dialog.  
The master document automatically receives the extension .sxg (e.g. "Master.sxg").  
The sub-documents receive names derived from the master document.  
The first sub-document receives the same name as the master document with the serial number 1 at the end, but with the extension .sxw ("Master1.sxw").  
The second document receives the name "Master2.sxw", and so on.  
You will find the names of the partially created documents here.  
In case you want to edit a partial document, double-click a name and select Edit in the Navogator.

Use this command to save all open documents.  
This command is only active if at least two files have been modified.  
The documents are saved under their respective path and name and overwrite the previous version.  
When you save a new file for the first time, or a copy of a read-only file, the Save As dialog appears where you specify the name and file location.  
Versions  
This is where you can save several versions of one document.  
Save an additional version of the document with the Version command.  
You can create and delete versions in the Version dialog.  
If you save a file with versions using the Save As option, the version information will not be saved with the file.

Confirm the selection with the Return key.  
Every click on the icon undoes the previous command, then the one before that, and so on.  
You can set the number of steps that you can undo in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General.  
Note that not all commands (e.g. changing styles) can be undone with this function.  
Notes for database tables  
For database tables it is only possible to undo the last command.  
This is not possible with the database tables.  
Please notice when you are editing database tables: content changes to the already saved table can be reversed with the Reverse icon.  
Instead, the procedure "Enter a New Record" will be saved, that is the record will be completelely erased.  
Note for presentations  
If you select a new slide layout in a presentation, the list of undo actions must be deleted.  
A note appears reminding you of this, and if necessary you can cancel your choice of a new slide layout.

You can see this command in the Edit menu under Repeat.  
Cutting  
Use Cut to move the selected object or section to the clipboard.  
This involves deleting the object or section from the document, moving it to the clipboard and then pasting it into a document as often as required.  
Copying  
Use this command to copy the selected text or object into the clipboard.  
The document itself does not change, but any existing clipboard contents are overwritten.  
%PRODUCTNAME also supports the clipboard on Unix systems.  
In order to copy from %PRODUCTNAME to the clipboard you must, however, use the normal commands in %PRODUCTNAME (short cut keys (Ctrl)(C) or the Copy icon on the function bar or in the menu Edit - Copy).  
In the other application it is sufficient to press the middle mouse button.  
To copy from another application simply select the text to be copied and then in %PRODUCTNAME start the command to paste from the clipboard (shortcut keys (Ctrl)(V) or Paste icon on the function bar or in the menu Edit - Paste).  
Paste  
This command inserts the contents of the clipboard into the document.  
From the list box (long mouse click on the icon) you can select in what format the content of the clipboard is to be pasted.  
The contents are inserted at the cursor position.  
Any selected text or objects are replaced by the pasted contents.  
If an area has been selected which is larger than one line or column but smaller than the clipboard contents, you will be queried if this is correct when pasting cells from the clipboard.  
If confirmed the clipboard contents will be pasted over the limits of the selected area.  
pasting contents pasting contents  
This is where you define the format in which clipboard contents are pasted into the document.  
The clipboard can contain various types of data, including text, images, graphics, cells, and sound files, but only one of these elements at a time.  
In the Paste Special dialog, you can choose the format for inserting the clipboard contents.  
The dialog appearance changes depending on the type of contents in the clipboard.  
This is described below.  
In all other cases, the normal Paste Special dialog appears and this is described first.  
Source  
This fields displays the data type in the clipboard, if the operating system was able to determine it.  
Selection  
Under Selection specify how the contents should be inserted.  
Paste Special  
This dialog appears if the clipboard data contains spreadsheet cells.  
Selection  
This area contain a selection of how clipboard contents can be inserted.  
Paste all  
If you select this check box, all contents from the marked cell range are pasted.  
You must mark this field if a linked area contains empty cells, since otherwise in the target document the subsequent filling of the empty cells will not be noticed.  
Strings  
If this box is marked, only character strings will be inserted.  
Numbers  
If you mark this box, only numbers will be inserted.  
Date & Time  
Mark this box to insert only date and time values.  
Formulas  
Mark this box to insert only formulas  
Notes  
Mark this option to insert only the notes added to the cells.  
Formats  
Mark this box to insert only the cell format attributes.  
Operations  
Select the operation to be used when combining cells from the clipboard with cells in the selected cell range.  
This functionality requires the Numbers check box under Select to be activated, and that the cells in the selected cell range already contain values.  
The existing values in the target area will be connected with the corresponding values in the clipboard according to the selected operation.  
In the case of an empty cell in the source area, the handling differs depending on whether the Skip empty cells option is selected.  
None  
Inserts the values from the clipboard.  
Add  
Adds the values of the clipboard to the values in the target area.  
Subtract  
Subtracts the values of the clipboard from the values in the target area.  
Multiply  
Multiplies the values of the clipboard with the values in the target area.  
Divide  
Divides the values of the clipboard by the values in the target area.  
Options  
These functions determine how the contents should be inserted.  
Skip empty cells  
If you select the Skip empty cells option, the target cell will remain unaffected when you insert an empty cell.  
Also, when selecting the "Multiplication" or "Division" option the target cell will remain unaffected.  
Unless the check box Skip empty cells is selected, empty cells will be taken into account.  
An empty cell in the source area will replace the contents of the corresponding cell in the target area if it is inserted without any operations.  
For the multiplication and division operations, an empty cell is converted to a cell with 0 as its content.  
This means that the result of the multiplication is always 0, and the division operation results in the error message #VALUE!.  
transposing  
If you mark this box, the contents of the clipboard will be transposed while inserting; rows become columns and vice versa.  
Link  
Mark the Link option to ensure that changes made to the source data (and copied to the clipboard) will also be made to the corresponding values in the target area.  
If you want to include subsequent changes in cells empty at that moment, you must select the Insert All option.  
You can also link sheets within the same spreadsheet.  
If the link extends to other documents, a DDE link is automatically created.  
A DDE link is inserted as a matrix formula and can only be modified as a whole.  
Shift Cells  
Here you can specify what happens with the existing cells when new cell contents are inserted.  
Don't shift  
Mark this box if you do not want the inserted contents to shift existing cells.  
Down  
This option moves down the existing cells while inserting contents.  
Right  
This option moves right the existing cells while inserting contents.

Under Tools - Options - Text documents - Changes you can change these settings to fit your needs.  
A change is always saved with the following information:  
The author who made the changes is read from the user data entered in %PRODUCTNAME (Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - User Data).  
The date and time of the change are taken from the system setting.  
A commentary on the change can be made via Edit - Changes - Commentary.  
When you position the mouse-pointer on the revision mark in the document, the Help Tip will display the author, date and time.

In this dialog, you can accept or reject individual changes made to a document.  
List  
Accept or reject individual changes and view additional information on this tab.  
On of this page On this tab, all changes matching the entered filter criteria are listed.  
There is, however, one exception:  
For nested changes, dependencies are shown regardless of the filter.  
Nested changes are changes where different actions overlap in a text passage.  
This could occur if several authors make changes to a text position.  
For example, if author A inserts a text in a passage of the document and then author B deletes part of this text.  
If you now set the filtering criteria to see only the changes of author A, the deletion of author B also appears, because the original insertion by author A no longer corresponds to the current state of the document.  
If several changes were carried out on a cell, these changes are summarized in an entry in the list.  
Click the plus sign beside this entry to view the details of the individual changes.  
If different changes were made to a cell and at least one change satisfies the filter criteria, all changes are always displayed, regardless of the filtering criteria entered.  
When a filter is turned on, the different entries in the list of changes appear in color.  
In this case, the different colors have the following meaning:  
Color  
Meaning  
black  
The entry can be accepted or rejected and corresponds to the filter criterion.  
blue  
The entry can be accepted or rejected but does not correspond to the filter criterion.  
However, there are one or more subentries that correspond to the criterion.  
gray  
The subentry can be accepted or rejected and does not correspond to the filter criterion.  
green  
The subentry can be accepted or rejected but does correspond to the filter criterion.  
Selection field  
A list of all recorded changes made to the document appears here.  
If you select an entry in the list, it will show the corresponding change in the document.  
A multiple selection with the Ctrl - Key is also possible.

You can control the view of the list as usual, e.g., sort the list by clicking the column headers, set the optimal width by double-clicking a separator line between the column headers, etc.  
In the context menu of an entry, you will find additional commands for changing the sorting order and editing the comment.  
As soon as you accept or reject a change, the entries of the list are re-ordered hierarchically, according to "Accepted" and "Rejected", in order to sort the overview.

When using another data source, here you can assign its field names and the field names used in %PRODUCTNAME to one another.  
Data source  
Opens the Select Data Source dialog, in which you can select the data source used for the Bibliography Database.  
All the data sources registered in %PRODUCTNAME are displayed for you to choose from.  
scale  
With this function you can change the scale for the page view.  
100% is the normal scale, other percentages zoom in or out of the view.  
The currently selected scale can be seen from the status bar.  
If you exchange %PRODUCTNAME documents across platforms, you may find that 100% in Unix on the same monitor and with the same resolution looks smaller than 100% in Windows.  
The reason for this is that Windows itself enlarges the view by some 30% in order that small fonts are easier to read.  
In Windows you would therefore have to set a scale of 75% in order to have the same view as on the other platforms.  
For the scaling of the dialogs (Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - View) however, the platforms use other mechanisms so that an 8-point font in a dialog may look different from an 8-point font in a document.  
Zoom factor  
Select one of the given enlargement or reduction scales.  
Full page  
The document page is completely displayed in the document window.  
Page width  
The document page is enlarged / reduced so that the page borders of the document are visible on the window.

This option results in a 75% reduction from the original size of the page.  
50%  
This option results in a 50% reduction of the document page.  
Variable  
Here you can set the enlargement / reduction as variable.  
If no changes are made, the last value specified will be activated.  
Enter the desired enlargement / reduction scale, or use the arrow buttons next to the spin box to set the scale in procent.  
Function Bar  
With this menu command you can activate or deactivate the view of the function bar.

You can toggle the appearance by using the small button to the right in the object bar or by using the corresponding context menu.  
If you exit a work area (i.e. a table), %PRODUCTNAME Writer recalls which object bars were active and restores them again when you return to the working area.  
Main Toolbar  
This command switches the Main Toolbar on or off.  
This toolbar has various functions available that help you work in your current document.

Chart results in worksheet  
If you want to insert a chart in a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet consisting of multiple sheets, specify in this list box in which diagram you want to insert the chart.  
<< Back  
In the AutoFormat dialog, you can use this button to return to a previous step.  
The current settings will remain unchanged.  
You can select this button after completing the second editing step or more.  
Next >>  
With this button, the AutoPilot uses the current settings and jumps to the next editing step.  
If you have reached the last step, this button can no longer be selected.  
Finish  
With this button, the AutoPilot will create a chart based on the settings defined in the AutoFormat dialog, and will insert it into your document.  
Example for multiple selection  
A selected contiguous range of cells will be used to display an inserted chart.  
In the case of a multiple selection, however, %PRODUCTNAME Calc has to first decide if the non-contiguous cells can be utilized to show a chart.  
The aim is to filter out the rows and columns that have not been selected from the selected cells and to merge the remaining areas.  
If this happens without gaps then the chart is created with the merged areas.  
If gaps remain then the individual selections are written among one another.  
You have, for example, defined the following selection:  
Here we will automatically create a for shelve 1 a chart for January, March, April and May.  
Look at the following multiple selection:  
This multiple selection does not combine into a feasible range, therefore, the chart created would be meaningless.  
It would be better to combine, for example:  
Here we'll create a chart for the shelves 2 and 4 and for February and March.  
Cell A1 is empty, so it does not make sense to select it, too.  
Remove A1 and see what happens:  
This multiple selection works fine.  
A chart for February and April, for shelves 2 and 4 is created.

This also applies to basic arithmetic operations.  
You can manually assign another format to the cells.  
Format  
A list of all formats is displayed here.  
The selection made in this area determines which entries appear in the Format Code field and whether the Options are activated.  
currency category list boxes  
Features of the number formats  
You have here the option to select various currencies (for example the Euro) for each of the different formats in this display field.  
The corresponding currency symbol will simultaneously appear.  
Currency formats can be set independently of the language/country.  
The format code is constructed according to the [$xxx-nnn] pattern.  
For Germany and the Euro, therefore, [$-407] is set.  
The number is an internal program country code which does not necessarily have to be entered, however, if you wish to define your own format.  
Special banking symbols, for example EUR, are always coded without the country code.  
The currency formats displayed in the list box are then the result of a combination of the settings in the Language field and the Format field.  
Use the thousands separator to format convenient currency formats according to the 00 T pattern.  
If, for example, you want to generate all entries in the format "thousand Euro with one decimal point", enter the format code as 0,0. [T].  
If you then enter the number 1234 in a cell formatted in this way it takes the format you want, namely 1,124T.  
Language  
Here you can select a different language if you wish to use foreign number formats.  
The language selection influences the date and currency format.  
If you change the language here, all cells that have been formatted with the default date format or the default currency format will take on the new country-specific date or currency format.  
This does not apply to user-defined formats.  
Assume that you have entered "1" in a cell and then saved your document.  
Subsequently this file may be opened on an English system.  
Here the default currency format is excluded for the cell concerned and your input is also retained on the foreign-language system.  
Source format  
If this field is marked, %PRODUCTNAME selects the number format from the cell format of the cells from which the chart was created.  
If you want a user-defined number format, you must first undo the marking of this field.  
Options  
This is where you can alter the display of cell contents in some formats.  
Decimal places  
Define the amount of decimal places for numbers in a certain number format.  
Leading zeroes  
Here you can define the number of leading zeros.  
Negative numbers in red  
Mark this field if negative numbers, formatted in a specific number format, are to be shown in red.  
Use thousands separator  
Mark this field if a period is to be used as the thousands separator in large numbers with a specific format.  
Format code  
Displays the format code selected in the Format field.  
You can also create custom format codes in the "User-Defined" category.  
For user-defined formats, you can select between the Add, Remove, and Edit Comment options.

Click here to add the specified format code to the user-defined category.  
Delete  
Click here to delete the specified format code from the user-defined category.  
The changes are affective after you have restarted your computer.  
Modify Comment  
Click this icon to insert or modify a comment shown below the Format code field.  
The default is "User-defined".  
If a user defined format code has been used, you can click this icon.  
It opens a text input filed used to enter a comment about this format.  
Name line  
Here you can enter a name for your self defined format.  
Subsequently click the symbol Change Name to enter the name.  
Number Format Codes  
The number format codes (under Format - Cell - Number format can consist of up to three sections separated by a semicolon (;).  
If the code has two sections, the first represents positive values and zero, and the second negative values.  
If a code has three sections, the first is for positive values, the second for negative values and the third for zero.  
You can also define conditions yourself, in this case you can make the first section of hits dependent on the first condition, the second section dependent on the second condition and the third section will only be run if the first two conditions do not apply.  
An example is found at the end of this page.  
Use Scientific to display numbers which exceed the width of the cell.  
To display a certain number of digits (0 or #) to the left and right of the decimal separator (period), insert the separator in the number format.  
If the format only contains the number sign (#) to the left of the decimal separator, numbers which are less than 1 will begin with a period.  
To create placeholders for numbers, enter the following format codes in a section.  
If the number has more places to the right of the decimal point than there are placeholders in the format, the number will be rounded according to the number of placeholders.  
If the number contains more digits left of the decimal point than are placeholders in the format, the actual numbers will be displayed.  
Placeholders  
Explanation  
#  
doesn't display extra zeros.  
0 (Zero)  
displays extra zeros if the number has less places than zeros in the format.

E  
Number of the year within an era, with a leading zero for single-digit years  
EE or R  
Era, full name and year  
RR or GGGEE  
You can adopt the following character strings into the format code if you want to use a certain calendar format.  
If there is no specific code entered, %PRODUCTNAME will choose the best-possible calendar to be used.  
[~gregorian]  
Gregorian Calendar  
[~gengou]  
Japanese Gengou Calendar  
[~ROC]  
Korean Calendar  
All calendar formats are dependent upon the "locale" setting, which you can select in Tools - Options - Language settings - Languages.  
An example:  
The date format code, E, EE, R or RR switches the calendar to the first non-Gregorian calendar that is entered in the current locale setting.  
If you use a Japanese locale setting this is the Gengou calendar.  
If you use a Korean locale setting this is the ROC calendar.  
If no other calendar is entered in the locale setting, the Gregorian calendar is used.  
When you calculate with cell references in which at least one of the references is assigned a date or time format, the result is automatically displayed in a corresponding format.  
You can, however, manually assign a different format to the formula cell.  
You have the following options:  
Initial Format  
Result Format  
Date + Date  
Number (Days)  
Date + Number  
Date  
Date + Time  
Date&Time  
Date + Date&Time  
Number  
Time + Time  
Time  
Time + Number  
Time  
Time + Date&Time  
Date&Time  
Date&Time + Date&Time  
Time  
Date&Time + Number  
Date&Time  
Number + Number  
Number  
The Date&Time format displays the date and time and is created as soon as a value in date format is added to a value in time format.  
Besides addition, you can also subtract, multiply or divide values.  
In the default setting, the date serial number 0 corresponds to 12.  
If you enter a two-digit year, the 29/30 rule will apply to determine whether it is 19xx or 20xx.  
For example, 1/1/10 will be calculated as the year 2010, while 1/1/30 will be calculated as 1/1/1930.  
When opening documents made in an earlier version than %PRODUCTNAME Calc 5.0 (in which nearly all two-digit years have the prefix 19, except the last days of 1899, see above), the old rule applies.  
Number Format Codes for Time Formats  
To display hours, minutes and seconds insert the following format codes.  
Format  
Format Code  
Hours as 0-23  
h  
Hours as 00-23  
hh  
Minutes as 0-59  
m  
Minutes as 00-59  
mm  
Seconds as 0-59  
s  
Seconds as 00-59  
ss  
You can also use the decimal point in format code to display fractions of seconds.  
For example, with the code hh:mm:ss,00 you show the time as 01:02:03,45.  
To show a time with more than 24 hours or more than 60 minutes or seconds, place the outer left part of the code in square brackets.  
For example, the time code [h]:mm:ss will display more than 24 hours.  
You can calculate with time formats as you would with number formats.  
Duration=End time-Start time.  
If a time is entered in the form 02:03,45 or 01:02:03,45 or 25:01:02, the following formats will be assigned if no other time format is set:  
MM:SS,00 or [HH]:MM:SS,00 or [HH]:MM:SS.  
For addition and subtraction of times, the value of the cell is displayed in a format according to the result.  
For example, this follows the pattern =End time - Start time or =(End time - Start time)*24*Hourly rate.  
Number Format Codes of Currency Formats  
For the currency format the currency symbol that is available according to the locale setting is specified as the default, if you have selected Default as the language.  
The Euro currency can be entered with one of the following format codes:  
#.##0,00 "EUR";[ROT]-#.##0,00" EUR "  
#.##0,00 [$-407];[RED]-#.##0,00 [$-407]  
The EUR banking symbol is the international abbreviation for the Euro.  
You see the second example if you select the "Deutsch (Deutschland)" entry in the Format combo box.  
The [$-407] part of the format code means that the Euro symbol () and the locale setting 407 are used.  
You select the code for a locale setting in the Format combo box.  
The code is then automatically entered correctly in the Format-Code field.  
Number Format Codes for Text and Spaces  
To display symbols, either enclose the symbol in double quotation marks or place a backslash (\) before it.  
To create a space the width of a character in the code format, insert an underscore (_) followed by this sign.  
By entering an underscore and a closing bracket, for example, positive numbers will be displayed flush with negative numbers in brackets.  
To include text in a number format, insert the @ sign in the format.  
The text entered will be formatted according to the section containing the @ sign.  
If the format does not contain any text, the text you enter will not be affected by the format.  
Other Number Format Codes  
To display numbers as percentages, (i.e., the number is multiplied by 100) add the percent sign to the number format.  
Scientific Format  
To display numbers in scientific format, add the following format codes to a section.  
If a format contains a 0 or the # sign to the right of an E-, E+, e- or e+, %PRODUCTNAME will display the number in scientific format and adds an "E" or an "e." The number of zeros or # signs to the right determine the number of exponential places.  
E- or e- will show a minus sign for negative exponents.  
E+ or e+ will display a minus sign in negative exponents and a plus sign in positive exponents.  
Formats with Prefixes and Suffixes  
You can add text extensions to number formats (prefixes and suffixes) and format cells with these codes.  
For example, define the following format code:  
0 "plus";0" minus";0 "Null"  
Using this code, the cell values are displayed as rounded integers, with the text enclosed in quotation marks added as a suffix (the text is displayed without quotation marks in the cell).  
In this example, by entering "1" in a cell the result will be "1 plus." Entering "-5" will produce "5 minus."  
Conditions in Number Formats  
You can directly include conditions as comparisons to numbers in the format code.  
Look at the following example:  
[<=4][GREEN]#.##0,00;[>7][RED]#.##0,00;[BLUE]#.##0,00  
In this case a cell is formatted in the number format #.##0,00.  
If the value in the cell is smaller that or equal to 4 the text color green will be used, red will be used for a value over 7.  
The text color blue will be used in all other cases.  
The relational operators <, <=, >, >=, = and<> can be used in combination with any number whatsoever.  
Country Specific Number Formats  
In the Number Format dialog On the Numbers tab page you can use country-specific format definitions.  
The standard date format as well as the standard currency format are organized in a country-specific manner by %PRODUCTNAME.  
The currency formats of %PRODUCTNAME can be set independent of the country or the language.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can also define your own currency formats.  
Be aware that when exporting platform independence is not guaranteed.  
In addition, the euro currency format is available in %PRODUCTNAME.

Aligning (Objects)  
Use this function to align objects.  
The alignment options depend on the type of object and its anchoring.  
It also makes a difference if a multiple selection has been carried out or not.  
Therefore, several selected drawing elements or several control fields will be aligned relatively to one another if they are anchored to the page or paragraph but not to a character.  
For drawing elements and control fields, you can find You can find on the main toolbar main toolbar object bar the Alignment icon Align icon which you can use to open or detach a window.  
This window has icons for each of the alignment functions described here.  
Left  
Multiple objects will be aligned to the object furthest left.  
If the object is anchored to a page, paragraph, character or border, it is aligned left relative to the reference element.  
This function is not available for character anchoring.  
For example, the reference element can be a paragraph or an entire page.  
It is set on the Type tab.  
When several elements are selected (e.g. drawing elements, controls), they are aligned with the leftmost object.  
This relative alignment occurs only with multiple selections, not when the elements are grouped.  
Grouped elements behave like a single object during alignment.  
Center  
If multiple objects are selected, all objects are positioned with their middle point in one line.  
If the object is anchored to the page, paragraph, character or frame, it is aligned centered horizontally relative to the reference element.  
This function is not available for character anchoring.  
If several elements are selected (e.g. drawing elements or controls), they will be aligned horizontally centered in relation to each other so that the midpoints are one above the other.  
Their vertical position will not be affected.  
Right  
If multiple objects are selected, all objects are aligned to the object furthest to the right.  
If the object is anchored to the page, the paragraph, a character or the frame, it is flushed right based on the reference element.  
This function is not available for anchoring to a character.  
When several elements are selected, e.g., drawing elements or controls, they are all aligned with their right margins on the rightmost side of the object.  
Top  
If multiple objects are selected, the top edge of all objects are aligned to the object furthest to the top.  
If the object is anchored to the side, paragraph, character or border, it is aligned with the top of the reference element.  
This also applies to character anchoring, except that in this case the baseline is selected as the reference line and the bottom of the object touches the baseline.  
For example, the reference element can be a text area.  
It is set on the Type tab.  
When several elements are selected (e.g. drawing elements, controls), they will all be aligned with the topmost object.  
Middle  
If multiple objects are selected, their midpoints are positioned along a vertical line.  
If the object is anchored to the page, paragraph, character or border, it is aligned vertically centered relative to the reference element.  
When several elements are selected, e.g. drawing elements and controls, they are aligned vertically centered relative to each other so that their midpoints are at the same height.  
The horizontal position is not affected.  
Bottom  
If multiple objects are selected, they are aligned at the bottom margin of the object.  
When the object is anchored to the page, paragraph, character or frame, it is aligned with the reference element such that the bottom of the object is aligned relative to the bottom of the reference element.  
The same applies to "as character" anchoring, although if the baseline is selected as the reference element, the top of the object is placed on the line containing all the characters in the row (baseline).  
When several elements are selected, e.g. drawing elements or controls, the bottom sides are aligned to the bottom of the lowest object.  
Alignment (Text Objects)

Horizontally  
Use this command to flip objects horizontally.  
The left side of the object will become the right side of the flipped object.  
Arrangements  
Following is a summary of the commands used for positioning objects one behind the other.  
This function is only available if a corresponding object has been selected in your document.  
Here it may be a case of a border, a graphic, a draw object, a control or another inserted object such as an OLE object or a chart.  
Imagine that your pages are composed of three transparent layers: the text layer, the graphic layer in the foreground and a graphic layer in the background.  
These layers rest directly on top of each other, one containing text and the others the graphics.  
All graphic objects in the graphic layer lie on top of each other, the first element at the bottom, and subsequent objects on top; whereby the bottom elements are overlapped or hidden by other objects.  
Each new graphic element first appears in the graphic layer in the foreground, covering the text layer.  
Form controls have an additional controls layer.  
Controls are located only in the controls layer.  
They are always drawn last, and are optically above all other objects and text on the page.  
Yet, object selection is still based on the internal object sequence.  
For example, if you draw a control first, then a rectangle that partially covers the control and click a part of the screen where both objects are, the rectangle will always be selected.  
The order of the graphic objects within the graphic layer can be modified using the first four submenu commands, while the last two commands arrange the selected objects behind or in front of the text layer.  
Bring to Front  
Use this command to position the selected object to the front.  
If there are other objects in the same position, they will be totally or partially covered.  
Bring Forward  
Use this command to bring the selected object one step forward.  
Send Backward  
Use this command to move the selected object one step backwards.  
Send to Back  
Use this command to set the selected object behind all other objects.  
If there are other objects on the same position, the object will be partially or totally covered.  
To Foreground  
This command moves the selected object /s to the foreground.  
They are positioned before the text and cover it.  
This function is available only if you select one or more drawing elements.  
New drawing elements appear automatically in the foreground.  
This command can be executed only if you first place the elements in the background.  
To Background  
The command To Background in the context menu or the icon of the same name can be used to send the selected object to the background.  
The elements moved in this way are set and displayed behind the text.  
An object set in the background cannot be reselected.  
In this case, choose the Selection icon from the Draw Functions floating toolbar.  
This procedure selects the object.  
Anchoring  
Choose how the selected object is to be anchored: either to the page or a cell to the page, selected paragraph, character, or as character.  
If the object is within a frame, you also have the option of anchoring the object to the frame.  
When you create a frame or a draw object, the program checks if the object is located completely in another frame.  
If this is the case, the object is anchored to the paragraph within the frame.  
To Page  
This command anchors the selected object to the page.  
The object cannot be moved to another document page when text is changed.  
The frame remains on the currently selected page, changes in the text area do not affect the frame order.  
If this type of anchor is selected, the anchor icon appears at the top left corner.  
To Paragraph  
This command anchors the selected object to the current paragraph.  
If the paragraph position is modified because of text changes, the frame also moves to a new position.  
If this type of anchoring is selected, the anchor icon appears on the left page margin at the upper corner of the object.  
To Character  
This command anchors the selected object to the current character.  
The position of the object moves in the document with the character position.  
In contrast to the "as character" anchor, the object does not appear as a character in the text, but its horizontal and vertical position is determined by the position of the character it has been anchored to.  
When you select an object anchored to a character, an anchor icon shows where the object is anchored on the character.  
You can anchor an object relative to a character.  
To do so, open the dialog used to edit objects, and select the Type page tab.  
If you position the object horizontally relative to a character in the Position area, a red vertical line appears as the reference element.  
When the cursor is placed before the character selected as an anchor, the line becomes the blinking text cursor.  
To Cell  
This command anchors the drawing element to a cell.  
If this type of anchoring is selected, the anchor icon is displayed in the upper left corner of the drawing element.  
To Frame  
This command anchors the selected object to the surrounding frame.  
This function is only available for objects inserted into a frame.  
As Character  
This command anchors the object as a character.  
An object anchored as a character appears as a normal letter in the text and as such it will influence the line height and break.  
If the text in the paragraph is modified, the horizontal position of the object will move accordingly.  
Editing Points  
This command edits the points of a selected drawing object.  
Click Edit Points on the object or options bar object or options bar object bar to turn the Edit mode on or off.  
The Edit Points command can also be chosen from the context menu of a selected drawing object.  
The Edit Points command can also be chosen from the context menu of a selected drawing object.  
When the Edit mode is active, each point of a curve or polygon can be set or moved using the mouse.  
Further icons for editing points are found in the Bézier object bar.  
FontWork  
Use FontWork to create various text effects.  
These effects can be assigned to text objects created with the draw functions on the main toolbar (icon Show Draw Functions).  
You can align the selected text object with FontWork to "invisible" semicircles, arcs, circles and freeform lines.  
You can replace this alignment object at any time by another alignment object.  
The FontWork command is found in the Format menu as soon as a draw element in a text document is selected.  
The FontWork functions are only active for text objects.  
Alignment icons  
In this area, you can assign selected text the shape of a semicircle, a circular arc or a closed circle.  
There are various icons at the top of the FontWork window.  
Click one of them to modify the selected text in the document accordingly.  
The top row contains icons for different semicircle forms.  
Here you can choose among upper semicircle, lower semicircle, left semicircle and right semicircle.  
Semicircles  
The second row contains icons for text alignment in the form of an arc: upper arc, lower arc, left show and right arc.

Working with Database Tables  
This section contains information about using database tables.  
If a table is open in the Design mode, it cannot be opened in the Data View.  
You have to first close the Design View or at least switch off the edit mode.  
Data source browser  
In the data source browser, editing commands are available on the database bar and in the context menus.  
A Navigation Bar at the bottom edge of the Data View allows for quick navigation within records.  
Selection in the data source browser  
The data source browser shows you the records of the loaded database table.  
On the left of the window, a pointer points to the current record; you can move this pointer with the up and down arrow keys, or with the buttons at the bottom of the window, or you can click a different record with the mouse.  
In the data source browser, there are various ways of editing individual fields, records or columns.  
To tell %PRODUCTNAME what you want to edit, you first have to select the relevant elements.  
The following table gives an overview of how to select individual elements in the data source browser:  
Task  
Action  
Selecting a record  
Click the row header  
Selecting several records or removing a selection  
Click the row header while pressing Ctrl or Shift.  
Selecting a column  
Click the column header  
Selecting an individual data field  
Click in the data field  
Selecting the entire table  
Click the upper-left corner  
Editing Tables  
There are also icons to use to edit the table (add, change or delete data).  
You can use the function bar icons Edit, Save and Undo.  
If a %PRODUCTNAME database table is open in write-protected format, first click the Edit icon on the function bar or on the database bar to release the table for editing.  
In edit mode, you can, for example, add new records and modify or delete existing data.  
You cannot change the structure of a database table, e.g. sequence or properties of the data fields, in Data View.  
For that you need to use the Table Design.  
When you edit a query, the changes are immediately applied in the database table.  
Data can be added, changed or deleted only if the query applies to a single table.  
A query across several tables is opened with write protection and can only be edited in Query Design.  
Database tables that require an index or primary key for identification of the data records cannot be edited (i.e. data entered, modified or deleted) if there is no index or primary key in the table definition.  
Cutting, copying and pasting data  
The Cut, Copy and Paste functions become available when an individual field is selected.  
The commands are available on the Edit menu, the function bar or the context menu of a selected cell.  
Command Ctrl +X, Command Ctrl +C, Command Ctrl +V.  
Copying by Drag&Drop in the table  
You can drag and drop to copy field contents within a table.  
To do so, select the contents of a field and drag it to a different field.  
Drag and Drop Copying Between Tables and Documents  
Simple text can be dragged from a %PRODUCTNAME document to a table cell with Drag&Drop.  
Text in the field will be overwritten.  
First, select the data field in the database table where you want to insert the text.  
Then select in the other document the text to be copied and drag it into the data field selected in the first step.  
If the table or query is currently shown in the data source view, simply drag the text from the current document into the data source view.  
The table must be in the Edit mode for text to be copied into it by drag and drop.  
You also have to first select the cell you want to copy the text into.  
Copying with Drag&Drop from a %PRODUCTNAME document is only possible with simple text; i.e. only alphanumeric characters (text or numbers).  
Yes/No, binary, image and counting fields.  
Working in the other direction, you can copy data from a database table into a document by drag and drop.  
The procedure is explained in the data source browser Help.  
Navigation within the table  
Use the Navigation Bar under Data View to jump to different records.  
First record  
With this button you place the pointer on the first record.  
Previous record  
With this button you place the pointer on the previous record.  
Record number  
Here you see the number of the current data record which refers to the pointer on the left window border.  
To place the pointer in the new position, enter here a different number and press the enter key.  
Here you also see the total number of records currently loaded.  
An asterisk (*) shows that not all records have been loaded.  
Next record  
With this button, you place the pointer on the next record.  
Last record  
With this button, you place the pointer on the last record.  
New record  
When you click the star icon, the cursor positions itself at the end of the database table so you can enter a new record.  
This function is only available when the database is in the edit mode.  
That is, the Edit icon must be activated on the database or function bar.  
Selection/Entire  
The form x/y indicates how many records are selected (x) and the total number of records (y).  
If the records are currently being read and counted in the background, a question mark will be displayed (y =?) instead of the total number of records.  
Organizing tables  
In the context menus of the column and row headers you will find different commands for changing the appearance of the table.  
You do not need to take any additional action to save the changes you make here, since %PRODUCTNAME includes your changes automatically.  
When you close the table and open it again, you will see that all the attributes which you have set still apply.  
The following commands are available for organizing tables:  
Table Format  
Row Height  
Column Format  
Column Width  
Table format  
Here you can carry out formatting which affects the selected rows.  
Delete Rows  
Use this command to delete one or more selected rows after confirming the query.  
This command can be activated only when you select the Edit icon on the database bar or function bar.  
Field format  
This is where you can apply the format to the active column or the selected columns.  
If you make field formatting changes here, the changes do not affect the format of individual fields within the database.  
For example, you cannot convert a text field to a numeric field or vice versa.  
The formatting you set here is only for viewing purposes.  
Format  
Hide Field  
Select this command to hide a field.  
To make it visible, select Show all Fields in the context menu.

Geometry  
The Geometry icon opens the corresponding area of the window.  
Geometry  
Geometry  
In this area, you'll find the options for changing the geometry of an object.  
An extrusion object is created by dragging a front surface into the third dimension on a path that is vertical to the front surface and whose length is indicated by the depth value.  
The back area becomes larger or smaller than the front area by a scaled depth value that differs from 100%.  
A rotation object is created when a 2D area is rotated on an axis positioned on the layer of this area.  
The area will be rotated on a circular path into the third dimension.  
Rotation objects do not have any depth values; however, they can show scaled depth values.  
If the value for the end angle is exactly 360 degrees, the front area covers the back area of the rotation object.  
Rounded edges  
You can define the degree of curvature for the object's rounded corners in this spin box.  
The default 3-D objects (the cube for example) can not be altered.  
You must first draw a 2-D square, then select the Convert to 3-D button to create a 3-D cube.  
Now you are able to round the edges of your object.  
Scaled depth  
This value describes the scale between the front and back area of a 3-D object.  
The front area will be increased or decreased according to the percentages given.  
Rotation angle  
This spin box defines the angles of a 3-D object, as long as the object has been created through rotation.  
The result will show a (more or less) open object.  
Depth  
In this spin box, you can specify the spacial depth of the object in inches.  
The settings are applied if, for example, a 3-D object has been created by selecting the Convert to 3-D button with a 2-D object.  
Segments  
Enter the number of segments you want to use to compose a 3D body.  
For example, to convert a torus to a three-dimensional triangle, set the number of horizontal segments to 3.  
Horizontal  
Specify the number of horizontal segments in this spin box.  
Vertical  
Specify the number of vertical segments in this spin box.  
Normals  
This area provides additional buttons to change the geometry of the selected object.

Show front/back  
If this button is applied, the 3-D object will be displayed as a closed body also when extended.  
This option can be applied to 3-D objects which have been created with an extrusion from a filled freehand line (in which the line crosses itself).  
The crossing of the 2-D lines will form several single 3-D object parts during the extrution.  
If the function is assigned as Show Front/Back, all 3-D object parts will contain complete top, bottom, and side areas.  
If the function is not selected, only the first object part will be completely closed, the other parts will remain partly open.

It is also possible to insert paragraphs without numbering and to remove individual paragraphs from the continuous numbering via keyboard entries, so that one level can comprise several paragraphs.  
Select the paragraphs on which you want to apply numbering or bullets.  
If no particular paragraphs are selected, the change will apply to the current paragraph.  
Display the dialog and select a bullet, a type of numbering, an outline or a graphic to represent the numbering or bullets.  
If you do not make any particular selection but exit the dialog with OK the current paragraph will be numbered with the default settings of the dialog.  
This causes the dialog to be closed at the same time.  
You can have several outline levels if you place the cursor directly after the bullets in a level and press the Tab key.  
If the cursor is in an outline level without a character or word being selected, the changes you make in the Numbering/Bullets dialog will apply to the entire level.  
If it least one character is selected, the change will apply to the currently selected paragraph.  
Changes that you make in the Numbering/Bullets dialog will always apply independently of the outline level to the currently selected paragraph.  
If the cursor is located in numbering or bullets, the icons required for editing the numbering or bullets is provided in the Numbering object bar Object bar Object bar.

Position  
Format the paragraphs here for the outline.  
This function is available for outline numbering (Tools - Outline Numbering) and for paragraphs that should have numbering or bullets (Format - Numbering/Bullets).  
If you are editing outline numbering, the formatting selected on the Position tab page is indirect formatting with styles since the formatting influences the Paragraph Styles assigned on the Numbering tab page.  
This is not linked to any specific style.  
Level  
The settings can be made on this tab page.  
The current formatting is displayed in the preview field.  
Select the option 1 - 10 to define the settings for all numbering levels.  
Positioning  
Here you can define the alignment, spacing and indentation for the numbering levels.  
Please note that the options entered here affect the formatting of the current paragraph, which is determined under Format - Paragraph... - Indents and spacing in the case of bullets and numberings.  
The settings made here are combined with the formatting of the current paragraph, which is determined under Format - Paragraph - Indents and spacing in the case of bullets and numberings.  
In the case of chapter numbering, you will find the formatting options on the corresponding tab page of the Paragraph Style.  
When you define the values for the distance between text and text frame on the Position tab, the values for the indent of the paragraph on the Indent section of the Indents and spacing tab are adjusted accordingly.  
Once you have entered other values there, the options entered for numbering/bullets are no longer considered.  
If you define the distance between numbering icon and margin on the Position tab via the indent, the values for the paragraph indent in the Indent section of the Indents and spacing tab are added to it.  
This behavior is new as of %PRODUCTNAME 5.2 since the line orientation in paragraphs has hitherto been manipulated using numbering.  
If you are importing older documents or are loading a %PRODUCTVERSION document into a %PRODUCTNAME version before 5.2, the indents and spacing of the numbering will be incorporated unchanged so that no differences are visible. %PRODUCTNAME automatically adapts the settings in the paragraph dialog under Indents and Spacing and in the Outline Numbering dialog under Position to the respective version accordingly.  
Indent  
In this spin box, define the distance between the left paragraph indent and the left border of the numbering symbol.  
If no left paragraph indent has been set on the Indents and Spacing tab page (from left = 0 cm), the indentation will appear with the distance between the left page border and the numbering symbol.  
With this spin button, you determine the distance between the left text frame and the left paragraph margin or numbering icon.  
This value is entered on the Indents and spacing tab as a left paragraph indent.  
Relative  
If this check box is selected, the indent value will be set relative to the one up outline level.  
This field is inactive in the first outline level.  
Distance to text  
You can determine here the distance between the numbering symbol and text.  
Minimum distance numbering<-> text  
Here you can define the minimum distance between the numbering symbol and the following text.  
This is a minimum distance which may be exceeded, for example, in a right-aligned paragraph for enough distance between the numbering symbol and text.  
Numbering Alignment  
You can determine the alignment options here.  
You can choose between a left, right and centered alignment.  
Under Minimum distance numbering<-> text, the existing minimum value between text and numberingwill remain the same, so that a centered or right alignment is only possible within the minimum value range.  
These alignment options only refer to the numbering icons and not to the entire chapter title or the numbered paragraph.  
The alignment of the paragraph is determined on the Alignment tab.  
Default

Customize  
This function helps you to individually costumize the program.  
The %PRODUCTNAME interface of other applications are for the most part freely configurable.  
This means that you can, for example, modify the arrangement and denomination of menu entries; further, you can modify the shortcut keys for activating individual functions and also customize the toolbars according to your preferences.  
You can adjust %PRODUCTNAME globally for every document of a certain type, or you can set a specific configuration for any %PRODUCTNAME document.  
A global adjustment applies to all documents of a particular type.  
For example, if you modify the Toolbars while a text document is active, the adjustment will apply to all text documents.  
If you want the adjustment to apply to a specific active document, you can add the configuration as an attachment to the file (See below).  
Alternatively, these functions are also accessible by clicking on the respective toolbar with the right mouse button.  
When loading user-defined menus, Toolbars and key configurations from files, first go to the appropriate tab, then click the icon to load.  
For example, if you want to load personal key settings from a file, go to the Keyboard tab.

Form Functions  
The Form icon opens a floating toolbar with the tools and functions needed to create an interactive form.  
The floating toolbar can be opened with your mouse only if no control fields has been inserted into the document yet.  
If the latter is the case, you have to hold the mouse button down briefly when clicking the Form icon in order to open the floating toolbar.  
A short mouse click always activates the control field inserted last, which is represented as the active element on the icon.  
Icon in the main toolbar:  
Form  
The formula function is available in text, HTML, table, presentation or drawing documents from von %PRODUCTNAME.  
Formula functions offer, for example, text fields where a user can enter text or buttons that initiate a certain action.  
These formula elements are called Controls in %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can design a form by inserting the different control fields that you require for the form into the document and define their properties.  
Forms can also be linked to a database.  
The fields then contain the corresponding data to be written to the database or to be read and displayed from the database.  
When designing a Web page, you can create forms as HTML documents.  
These forms can be used for a user entering data to be sent over the Internet.  
However, only formula properties that are supported by the chosen HTML version may be exported.  
You select the HTML version for export by choosing Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility.  
The form functions of your current %PRODUCTNAME version are not supported by versions before 5.0.  
When importing and exporting older document versions containing control fields, no conversion is performed.  
Instead of the control field and its properties, only red rectangles are imported and blue rectangles are exported; form properties are lost when importing and exporting.  
In order to insert a specific form object into the document, click the corresponding icon on the floating toolbar.  
The mouse pointer then indicates with crosshairs that you can drag the object open in the document.  
In order to create a square control field, press the Shift key while dragging.  
If you want to insert fields from the field list of a table or from a query into the form, simply drag them from the open table or query into the form.  
In text documents, a field command is inserted when using ordinary drag and drop; when dragging while holding the Command Ctrl +Shift key down, you create a form field.  
After you have inserted a form control into the document, you can assign the desired properties to it.  
Select the control and click the Control Properties icon or choose the menu command of the same name in the context menu of the control.  
A dialog appears where you can define the properties.  
You can copy controls from one document to another by using Drag&Drop or by first copying them into the clipboard and then pasting them into the new document.  
At the same time %PRODUCTNAME analyzes the three properties; "database", "data source" and "type of data source" so that it can be inserted in the correct position in the logical form structure of the target document.  
A control, which shows contents from the address book, for example, will show address book contents after it has been copied into the target document.  
The control will be automatically inserted into the target document either in the existing form structure or the latter will be created.  
The following control fields exist:  
Button  
Click this icon to create a command button.  
This function can be used, for example, to execute a command for a defined event, such as a mouse click.  
You can apply text and/or graphics to these buttons.  
Option field  
Click this icon to create an option field.  
This type of control enables the user to choose one of several options.  
Option fields with the same functionality are given the same name (Name property).  
Normally, they are given a group box.  
Check Boxes  
Click this icon to create a check box.  
Check boxes allow you to switch a function in a form either on or off.  
Label  
Click this icon to create a field for displaying text.  
These labels are only for displaying predefined text.  
Entries cannot be made in these fields.  
Group Boxes  
Click this icon to create a frame to visually group several controls.  
In this way, you can, for example, group check boxes or option fields in a frame.  
If you insert a group frame into the document, the AutoPilot Group Element starts, which allows you to easily create an option group.  
Note:  
When you drag a group frame over already existing controls and subsequently want to select a control, you have to first open the context menu of the group frame and choose Arrange Order - Send to Back.  
Then select the control while pressing Command Ctrl.  
Group fields use the visual view.  
A functional grouping of option fields can be done through the definition of names:  
Under the Name - Control Field Properties, enter the same name in order to group them.  
Text Box  
Click this icon to create a text box.  
Text boxes are fields in which the user can enter text.  
In a form, text boxes display data or allow for new data input.  
List Box  
Click this icon to create a list box.  
A list box lets users select an entry from a list.  
This AutoPilot helps you create the list box.  
Combination Fields  
Click this icon to create a combo box.  
A combo box is a single-line list box with a drop-down list from which users choose an option.  
You can assign the "read-only" property to the combo box so that users cannot enter other entries than those found in the list, but this does not have to be the case.  
If the form is bound to a database and the database connection is active, the helpful Combo Box AutoPilot will automatically appear after you insert the combo box in the document.  
Image Button  
Click this icon to create a button displayed as an image.  
Aside from the graphic representation, an image button has the same properties as a "normal" button.  
Image Control  
You can use this icon to create a graphic control.  
It can only be used to add images from a database.  
In the form view, double-click one of these fields to open the Insert Graphic dialog to insert the image.  
There is also a context menu (not in design mode) with commands for inserting and deleting the graphic.  
Images from a database can be displayed in a form and new graphics can be inserted in the database (as long as the graphic control is not write-protected).  
The control must refer to a database field of the image type.  
Therefore, enter the data field into the Properties control on the Data tab page.  
File Selection  
Click this icon to create a button that enables a file selection.  
Date Field  
Click this icon to create a date field.  
If the form is linked to a database, the date values can be adopted from the database.  
If you assign the "Show" property to the date field, the user can open a calendar to select a date under the date field.  
This also applies to a date field within a table control field.  
Date fields can be easily edited by the user with the cursor keys (UpArrow) and (DownArrow).  
Depending on the cursor position, the day, month, or the year is increased or decreased step by step,  
Specific Remarks on Date Fields.

Click this icon to create a currency field.  
If the form is linked to a database, the currency field contents for in the form can be adopted from the database.  
Pattern Field  
Click this icon to create a masked field.  
Masked fields consist of an input mask and a character mask.  
The character mask determines the state of the masked field when loading the form.  
Please note that masked fields are not taken into account in HTML format.  
Table Control  
Use this icon to create a control field for a database table.  
This dialog will help you create the control field.  
The table control field is a tabular view of a database form.  
It is used for the overview and fast data acquisition.  
If you link the form with a database, the table control field can display the data of the data source.  
Enter, delete, edit data, etc.  
Special Information about Control Fields.  
Selection  
This icon switches the mouse pointer to the select mode or deactivates this mode.  
The select mode is used to select the controls of the form in order, for example, to edit them.

Special properties of a formatted field  
Formatting:  
You can set the property by clicking in the Properties: Formatted Field  
You can then see a sample in front of this button.  
You cannot edit the sample in the text box, but you can delete it.  
Then the formatted field will display its content the way it is in the database in the table connected to this field, i.e. without changing anything in the formatting.  
If the formatted field is not connected to a database, a default number formatting will apply.  
If the formatted field is connected to the text field of a database, the entries in this field will be treated as text.  
If the formatted field is connected to a field of the database that can be displayed as a number, the input is treated as numbers. (The date and time are also handled internally as numbers).  
Min. value and Max. value:  
Here you can enter the minimum and maximum numeric value for the formatted field.  
For formatted fields that are connected to a text box, these two values and the default value described below are without meaning.  
The limit values determine the output of existing data (for example:  
Min. value is 5, the connected field name contains the integer value 3.  
Max. value is 10 and you enter 20.  
The input is corrected and 10 is written in the database).  
If the fields are not filled in for Min. value and Max. value, there is no restriction.  
Default value:  
This value is set for new records as the default value.  
If you open a document containing a formatted field using a %PRODUCTNAME 5.1 version, the formatted field is read as a text box.  
If you save the document in the 5.1 version, the formatted field permanently becomes a text box.  
Special Tips for Date Fields  
For two-digit years the date fields utilize the limiting value that is valid for all of %PRODUCTNAME and that you have selected in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General.  
If you enter a two-digit year that is not in the defined area, it is shown as a four-digit number for your review.  
If, for example, 1930 is defined as the limiting value according to the setting and you enter 2034, then you also see 2034 and not 34.  
The pre-set limit value will be saved for each document.  
If you save a document with a changed limit value of 1930 and open it in an older version of %PRODUCTNAME, you will see a warning saying that unknown data may be lost.  
In the older version of %PRODUCTNAME, only the previous limit value of 1930 applies.  
Special tips for table control fields  
You can configure a table control to display the desired records accordingly.  
In other words you can define field names for data display or for recording data as with a traditional database form.  
The following fields are possible in a table control: text, date, time and currency fields, numeric fields, masked field, check box and combo box.  
In the case of combined data/time fields, two columns are created automatically.  
The number of selected lines, if any are selected, is in parentheses after the total number of records.  
To insert columns into the table control, click in the header and bring up the context menu.  
The following commands can be run here:  
Insert Column  
Calls a submenu that enables you to select a data field to adopt it in the table control fields.  
Change to  
Opens a submenu where you can select a data field to replace the data field selected in the table control.  
Delete Column  
Deletes the currently selected column.  
Column...  
Opens the properties dialog of the selected column.  
If you click a column in design mode, the special properties dialog of this column also appears.  
The column properties correspond essentially to those in the Control Properties.  
The property for column width is also available here.  
Hide Column  
Hides the selected column.  
Its properties remain the same.  
Show columns  
Calls a submenu where you can select the columns to show again.  
To show only one column, click the column name.  
You see only the first 16 hidden columns.  
If there are more hidden columns, choose the More command to call the Show Columns dialog.  
More  
Calls the Show Columns dialog.  
In the Display Columns dialog you can select the columns to be shown.  
Hold down the (Shift) or (Ctrl) key to select multiple entries.  
All  
Click All if you want to show all columns.  
Configure the table control using drag and drop:  
Open the data source browser and drag the desired fields out of the data source browser and on to the table header.  
A pre-configured column is then created.  
If you hold down the (Shift)(Ctrl) key combination for Drag and Drop of a table column to the column heads of the table control, the submenu is displayed.  
Here you can select what type should be given to the column to be inserted in the table control.  
Control Properties  
Click here to open a dialog for editing the properties of the selected control.  
You can only call this dialog when in the Design mode with a control selected.  
If you enter data in the Properties dialog, note that multiline input is possible for certain drop-down combo boxes.  
This concerns all fields in which an SQL statement can be entered as well as the properties of text fields or labels.  
You can open these fields and enter text in the opened list.  
The following shortcut keys are relevant:

As with the conventional list or combo boxes, you can open or close the list with a mouse click the arrow on the right border of the field.  
However, the input here can be entered either in the opened list or in the top text field.  
An exception are the properties that expect a list representation, e.g., the property List Entries, which can be set for the control fields List Box and Combo Box.  
Here, you can only edit the entries when the field is opened.  
General  
This tab enables you to define the general control field properties in a form.  
You will notice that the listed properties are not the same for each control field.  
In the case of an HTML export, it is always the relevant default values that are exported, not the actual current values.  
Default values are determined - depending on the type of control - by the properties default value (e.g. for text fields), default status (for check boxes and option fields) and default selection (for list boxes).  
Active  
If a control field has the property "Active" (Yes), the form user will be able to use the control field.  
If it should not be available for the user, this property will not be activated (No) and will be displayed in a gray color.  
Number of lines  
Here you can enter how many lines should be displayed in the dropdown list.  
This setting is only active if you chose Yes in the the dropdown option.  
For lists or combo boxes with the Dropdown property, you can enter how many lines should be displayed in the dropdown list.  
With control fields which do not have the dropdown option, the line's display will be specified by the size of the control field and the lines presentation.  
Button type  
By selecting a certain button type, you determine which action should be initiated.  
By selecting the button type you determine which type of action should be initiated.  
In this way, a button can, for example, send files or reset to the custom control fields (the default values are determined depending on the special properties of the respective buttons).  
Choose from the following types and actions:  
Type  
Action  
Push  
When activating the button, no action is triggered.  
Reset  
Activating the button resets the settings in other control fields to the predefined default values (Default Status, Default Selection, Default Value).  
The user can therefore cancel changes made within a form that do not correspond to the default setting.  
Submit  
Activating this button sends the data that is entered in other control fields of the current form.  
The recipient's address is specified in Form Properties under URL.  
URL  
Activating this button activates a defined URL.  
The link address is specified under URL; under Frame, you can define the target frame.  
Certain types of buttons are used exclusively for HTML documents when designing a Web page.  
For database forms, this property is not relevant.  
Dropdown  
Enter, if the lists or the combo boxe should dropdown (Yes) or not (No).  
Lists or combination fields can have the dropdown property.  
A control field with the dropdown property has an additional arrow button which opens the list of the existing form entries per mouse click.  
Under Line count, you can determine how many lines (or rows) should be displayed in the dropdown state.  
Combo boxes that were inserted as columns in a table control are always dropdown as the default.  
Alignment  
Here you can specify the alignment option.  
Many controls have an Alignment property.  
Select one of the options to specify whether text should be left-aligned, right-aligned or centered.  
In the case of label fields, the alignment option refers to the title of the field, in the case of text fields to their content, and in the case of columns of a table control to the content of the table fields (data).  
In the case of buttons, the alignment refers to the alignment of a graphic which you insert in addition to the text or instead of a text.  
AutoComplete  
Determine here, if the combo box should have the AutoComplete function.  
You can determine if a combo box should have the AutoComplete function.  
That is, as long as the entry does not differ from the existing entries.  
Label field  
This is where you select the source for the label of the control.  
The text of the label field is inserted everywhere, where the name of a source database field should be, that is, for example, in the Filter Navigator, Search dialog and as a column name in the table view.  
Only the text of a group frame can be used as the label field when using radio buttons.  
This text applies to all of the radio buttons of the same group.  
If you click on the... button next to the text field, you will see the Label Field Selection dialog.  
Select a control from the list of available controls here.  
Remove the marking from the field no assignment, as otherwise controls cannot be assigned as label fields.  
You can remove the link to a label field with this field.  
Width  
Sets the column width in the table control field in inches.  
With this property, you can determine the column width of the control fields in inches.  
Record marker  
Select here if the first column should be displayed with row labels in which, for example, the current record is displayed through a small arrow.  
Date format  
Determine here the desired format for the date readout.  
With date fields you can determine the format for the date readout.  
All format fields (date, time, currency, numeric) are formatted automatically in the selected format as soon as you leave them regardless of how you entered the input.  
Spin Button  
The Yes option transforms the control field into a spin button, where corresponding arrow buttons are added.  
That means that a control field will have arrow buttons which the user can use to vary the values.  
Tristate  
This property specifies if a check box can also represent ZERO values of a linked database apart from the TRUE and FALSE values.  
That is, if the database contains data fields that accepts three states TRUE, FALSE and ZERO.  
This property is only defined for database forms, not for HTML forms.  
Print  
Set this property, if you want the control field to appear in a document's printout.  
Edit mask  
Defines the edit mask.  
By specifying a character code you can determine what the user can enter in the control field.  
In masked fields, by specifying the character code, you can determine what the user can enter in the control field.  
The length of the edit mask determines the number of the possible input positions.  
If the user enters characters that do not correspond to the edit mask, the input is rejected when you leave the field.  
You can enter the following characters to define the edit mask:  
Character  
Meaning  
L  
A text constant.  
This passage cannot be edited.  
The character is displayed at the corresponding position of the Literal Mask.  
a  
The characters a-z can be entered here.  
If a capital letter is entered, it is automatically converted to a lowercase letter.  
A  
The characters A-Z can be entered here.  
If a lowercase letter is entered, it is automatically converted to a capital letter  
c  
The characters a-z and 0-9 can be entered here.  
If a capital letter is entered, it is automatically converted to a lowercase letter.  
C  
The characters a-z and 0-9 can be entered here.  
If a lowercase letter is entered, it is automatically converted to a capital letter  
N  
Only the characters 0-9 can be entered.  
x  
All printable characters can be entered.  
X  
All printable characters can be entered.  
If a lowercase letter is used, it is automatically converted to a capital letter.  
For the character mask "__.__.2000", for example, define the "NNLNNLLLLL" edit mask so that the user can only enter four digits when entering a date.  
Strict format  
You can have a format check with control fields that accept formatted contents (date, time, etc.).  
If the strict format function is activated (Yes) only the allowed characters will be accepted.  
For example, in a data field, only numbers, periods or colons will be accepted; all alphabet entries typed with your keyboard will be ignored.  
Target Frame  
For the "URL" button type, enter here the target frame where the downloaded frame should be displayed.  
In buttons that load a defined URL if pressed by the user (Type URL), enter the target frame where you want the downloaded URL to be displayed.  
Enter the URL address under URL.  
If you click the field, you can select an option from the opened list that specifies into which frame the next document should be loaded.  
There are the following possibilities.  
Entry  
Meaning  
_blank  
The next document is created in its own view, i.e., a new empty frame.  
_parent  
The next document is created in a parent, i.e., a frame of the level above; if no parent exists, the document is created in the same frame.  
_self:  
The document is created in the same frame.  
_top  
The next document is created in a top window, i.e., in the highest frame of the hierarchy; if this frame is already a top window, the document is created in the same frame.  
This property is relevant for HTML forms, but not for database forms.  
Graphic  
A graphic button has a Graphic property.  
Enter here the graphic's path and file name which you want to have displayed on the button.  
If you select the graphic file with the... button, the path and file name will be automatically included in the text box.  
Manual line break  
This is where you can allow a manual line break for a multiline field.  
This property only has an effect if you chose "Yes" under Multiline Input.  
Help text  
Here you have the option of entering a help text that will be displayed as a tip on the control.  
The tip shows the text in user mode when the mouse is moved over the control.  
For URL type buttons, the help text appears as the extended tip instead of the URL address entered under URL.  
Help URL  
Here you can enter a batch label in URL spelling which refers to a help document and which can be called with the help of the control field.  
The help of the control field help can be opened if the focus is positioned on the control field and the user presses (F1).  
Background color  
Here you can set the background color of the control field.  
For most of the control fields you can define a background color.  
If you click on Background color a list will open which enables you to select among various colors.  
The "Standard" option adopts the system setting.  
If the desired color is not listed, click the... button to define a color in the Color dialog.  
Horizontal scroll bar  
Here, you can define if the text box should have a horizontal scroll bar (Yes) or not (No).  
Text boxes can have a vertical or a horizontal scroll bar.  
If you want the text box to have a horizontal scroll bar, select the Yes option in the Horizontal scroll bar property.  
Value step  
This is where you specify spin box intervals.  
You can preset the value intervals in numerical and currency spin boxes.  
Use the arrow buttons of the spin box to increase or decrease the value.  
List entries  
Here you can define the list entries visible in the document.  
Open this list and enter your text.  
With list and combo boxes, you can define the list entries visible in the document.  
Simply open the List entries field and enter your text.  
Please note the tips referring to the entries control and keyboard.  
The predefined default list entry is entered into the default selection combo box.  
Note that the list entries entered here are only incorporated into the form if the option "Value List" is active on the Data tab under List Content Type.  
If you do not want the list entries to be written to the database and/or transmitted to the recipient of the Web form but rather assigned values that are not visible in the form, you can assign the list entries to other values in a value list (e.g., those of a database).  
The value list is determined on the Data tab.  
To do so, select the option "Value List" under Type of List Contents and enter the values under List Contents (e.g., field contents of a data field) that are to be assigned to the corresponding visible list entries of the form.  
For the correct assignment, the order in the value list is relevant.  
For HTML documents, a list entry entered on the General tab corresponds to the HTML tag <OPTION>; an entry of the value list entered on the Datatab under List Contentscorresponds to the <OPTION VALUE=...> tag.  
Date max  
Here you can specify a date which should not be exceeded by a user's entry.  
With date fields you can specify the date which can not be exceeded by a user's entry.  
That means, that a date that exceeds this date will be forbidden.  
Max. text length  
Here you can define the maximum number of characters that the user can enter.  
For text and combo boxes, you can define the maximum number of characters that the user can enter.  
If this control field property is uncertain, this will be distinguished in the default settings with a zero.  
If the control is linked to a database and the text length is to be accepted from the field definition of the database, you must not enter the text length here.  
The settings are only accepted from the database if the control property was not defined ("Not Defined" state).  
Value max.  
Here you can define a value for the control field which can not be exceeded by another value introduced by the user.  
A bigger value will be forbidden.  
For numerical and currency fields, you can determine a maximum value to impede the user to enter a higher value.  
Time max.  
For the time field, you can determine a time which can not be exceeded by another value introduced by the user.  
For time fields, you can determine a time which can not be exceeded by the user.  
With this, a later date will be forbidden.  
Multiselection  
Determine here, if a multiple entry selection is allowed.  
With list boxes you can determine if the user can select multiple entries.  
Multiline Input  
With this, the text will be displayed in various lines.  
With text boxes and labels you can have a multiline text display.  
A line break can be done by either pressing the enter key or automatically at the border of the control field.  
As a default, line breaks are not accepted but, if you want to accept them, set the Multiline Input property.  
Date min.  
For the date field, you can determine here a date to impede the user to introduce an earlier date.  
With date fields you can enter a date which impedes the user to enter an earlier date.  
That is, the user will not be able to enter an earlier date.  
Value min.  
You can determine here a value for the control field to impede the user to enter a lesser value.  
For numerical and currency fields you can determine a minimum value to impede the user to enter a lesser value.  
Time min.  
In the time field, you can determine here a time to impede the user to introduce an earlier time.  
With this, the user will not be able to enter an earlier time.  
Decimal accuracy  
Here you can determine the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point.  
With numerical and currency fields you can determine the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point.  
Name  
Here you can determine the name for the control field.  
Each control field has a Name property so that the control field can be easily identified.  
The name will appear in the Form Navigator and with the name, the control field can be referred from a macro.  
The control field specifies this name using the field's label and number.  
If you work with macros, make sure that the names of the controls are unique.  
The name is not only used for the unambiguous designation of a control but also to group different controls that belong together functionally.  
Controls with identical names form a group.  
Grouped elements can be represented visually by using a Group Frame.  
Navigation bar  
You can determine here if you want the navigation bar to be displayed on the lower border of the table control (Yes) or not (No).  
You are able to show it or hide it.  
Read-only  
This is where you determine if the control is read-only (Yes) or if it can be edited (No).  
This property can be assigned to all controls in which the user can enter text.  
In a graphics field which adopts graphics from a database, if you assign the read-only property, the user will not be able to insert new graphics into the database.  
Border  
Here you can determine if the field's border should be displayed "Without frame", with a "3-D look" or "Flat".  
With control fields that have a frame, you can determine the border display on the form using the Border property.  
You can select among the "Without frame", "3-D look" or "Flat" options.  
Order  
The Order property sets the order in which the controls are focused in the formula if the Tab key is pressed.  
If there are several controls in the formula, pressing the Tab key will move the focus to the next control.  
You can specify the order in which this occurs using an index to be copied under Order.  
The index of the first control that the focus should have is 1.  
The Order property does not exist for Hidden Controls.  
Graphic buttons and controls cannot be selected with the Tab key either.  
When creating a form, an index is automatically assigned to the control fields that are added to this form; every control field added is assigned an index increased by 1.  
If you change the index of a control, the indices of the other controls are updated automatically.  
Elements that cannot be focused (Tabstop = No) are also assigned a value.  
However, these controls are skipped when using the Tab key.  
You can also easily define the indices of the different controls in the Tab Order dialog.  
Reference value  
Here you can enter a reference value for the web form, which will be remitted to a server when sending the form.  
With database forms, the value entered here will be written in the database field, assigned to the control field.  
You can assign a reference value to option buttons and check boxes.  
The reference value will be remitted to a server when sending the web form.  
With database forms the value entered here will be written in the database assigned to the control field.  
Reference values for Web forms  
Reference values are useful if you design a Web form and the information on the status of the control is to be transmitted to a server.  
If the control is clicked by the user, the corresponding reference value is sent to the server.  
If you specify no reference value, "ON" is transmitted when sending the form if the control was activated by the user.  
If you have two control fields for the options "feminine" and "masculine", and assign a reference value of, for example, 1 to the field "feminine" and the value 2 to the "masculine" field, the value 1 is transmitted to the server if a user clicks the "feminine" field and value 2 is sent if the "masculine" field is clicked.  
If you assign no reference value, "ON" is sent for every activated control; if the two fields "feminine" and "masculine" are grouped, "ON" is transmitted for the group if one of the fields was clicked.  
Therefore, you should make sure to define reference values in the grouping if the transmitted information "ON" is not sufficient to characterize the state of the controls.  
Reference values for database forms  
For database forms, you can also characterize the status of an option or a check box by a reference value, storing it in the database.  
If you have a set of three options, for example "in progress", "completed", and "resubmission", with the respective reference values, "ToDo", "OK", and "RS", these reference values appear in the database if the respective option is clicked.  
Default status  
With this property you can specify if an option or a mark is defined by default.  
When you load the document, this status will be accepted.  
For a reset type button, you hereby define the state of the control if the reset button is activated by the user.  
For grouped option fields, the state of the group corresponding to the default setting is defined by the Default Status property.  
Default selection  
Determine which list box entry is to be marked as default.  
Use this list box property to determine which list entry is to be selected as the default.  
When the document is loaded, this defined condition is presumed, The first list entry is numbered 0, the next 1, etc.  
For a reset type button, an entry selected here defines the status of the list box if the reset button is activated by the user.  
Default value  
With the default value determine which entry in the control field is set by default.  
For example, the standard entry will be accepted when a form is opened or when new data is entered.  
For a reset type button, an entry made here defines the status of the control if the reset button is activated by the user.  
In particular, in the case of date and time fields, the current date or the current time in the form is indicated as a default if no other default value is defined.  
Default button  
With this property you specify that this button will be operated when you press the Return key.  
In a dialog or form with several buttons, one of them will be operated when you press the Return key.  
If you open the dialog or form and do not carry out any further action, the button with this property is the default button.  
This property should always be assigned only for a single button within the document.  
In the case of Web page forms, you might come across this property in search masks.  
These are edit masks that contain a text field and a Submit Type button.  
The search term is entered in the text field and the search is started by a activating the button.  
If the button is defined as the default button, however, simply hit Enter after entering the search term in order to start the search.  
Prefix symbol  
Use this field to determine if the currency symbol is to be displayed before or after the number when using currency fields.  
The default setting is currency symbols are not prefixed.  
Tabstop  
The Tabstop property determines if a control field can be selected with the tab key.  
The following options are available:  
Default  
The control field behaves as expected.  
For example, a caption is not selected as the default, whereas a text field is.  
No  
When using the tab key, focusing skips the control.  
The value defined under Order is kept.  
Yes  
The control can be selected with the Tab key.  
Thousands Separator  
If you want to insert a thousands separator, select here the Yes option.  
With numerical and currency fields you can determine if thousands separators should be used or not.  
Label  
The Label property sets the label of the control field which should be displayed in the form.  
The Label property sets the label of the control field which should be displayed in the form.  
With the table control columns, this property determines the visible label or the column header of the data field.  
When you create a new control, the description predefined in the Name property is used as the default for labeling the control.  
The label consists of the control field name and an integer numbering the control, i.e., CommandButton1, for example.  
With the Titel property, you can assign another description to the control so that the label reflects the function of the control.  
Change this entry in order to assign an expressive label to the control that is visible to the user.  
To have a multi-line title, open the field using the arrow buttons.  
You can enter a line break via the shortcut keys Command Ctrl +Enter.  
The Title property is only used for labeling a form element in the interface visible to the user.  
If you work with macros, note that, at runtime, a control is always addressed via the Name property.  
URL  
This address will be downloaded if the button is pressed.  
This address will be downloaded by clicking the button.  
This could be a file, a new form or a website in the internet.  
If you move the mouse over the button in User mode, the URL appears as the extended tip, provided that no other Help text was entered.  
Vertical scroll bar  
Determine here, if the text box should have a vertical scroll bar (Yes) or not (No).  
Text boxes can have a horizontal and a vertical scroll bar.  
If the text should have a vertical scroll bar, simply select "Yes" in the Vertical scroll bar property.  
Currency symbol  
You can enter here a character or a string for the currency symbol.  
In the Currency Field you can pre-define the currency symbol by entering the character or string in the Currency symbol property.  
Value  
Here, you can enter the data which should be adopted by the hidden control.  
In a hidden control, under Value, you can enter the data which has to be adopted by the hidden control.  
This data will be also transferred when sending the form.  
Password characters  
This code should be displayed instead of the characters typed by the user for the password.  
If the user should enter a password you can determine the characters that will be displayed instead of the characters typed by the user.  
Under Password characters, enter the ASCII code of the desired character.  
You can use the values from 0 to 255.  
The characters corresponding to certain ASCII codes can be seen in the Special Character dialog (Paste - Special Character...).  
Literal mask  
The literal mask will be defined here.  
The literal mask contains the initial values and is always visible after downloading a form.  
With masked fields you should determine a literal mask.  
It contains the initial values and is always visible after downloading a form.  
Using a character code for the Edit mask, you can determine the entries that the user can enter in the masked field.  
The length of the literal mask should always correspond to the length of the edit mask.  
If this is not the case, the edit mask is either cut off or filled with blanks up to the length of the edit mask.  
Character set  
You can select a character set here.  
This character set will be used to format the text in the control field.  
For control fields which have a visible text in the form or a title, you can select a character set which will be used to display the text in the form.  
The selected character set will be used to name control fields.  
In a table control field, the character set determines the data display.  
In this dialog, you can also set the color for the text display inn the control field.  
Row height  
Determine here the row height (in millimeters) in a table control field.  
In table control fields, you can determine the row height in millimeters.  
Time Format  
You can define the desired format for the time display.  
With time fields you can define the desired format for the time display.  
Help text  
Here you can enter additional information or a descriptive text for the control field.  
In each control field you can enter additional information or a descriptive text for the control field.  
This property helps the programmer to save additional information which can be used in the program code.  
This field can be used, for example, for variables or other evaluation parameters.  
Data  
In this tab page you can assign a data source to the selected form element.  
For forms with database links, the associated database is defined in the Form Properties.  
You will find the functions for this on the Data tab.  
The possible settings of the Data tab of a control depend on the respective control.  
You will only see the options that make sense for the current control.  
There are the following fields on this tab:  
Data field  
Enter here the table form field to which the data content of the control field should refer to.  
With database forms you can relate single control fields with the data fields.  
There are the following possibilities.  
1st Case:  
There is only one table in the form.  
Under Data Field, you specify the field of the form table whose contents you want to be displayed.  
2nd Case:  
The control belongs to a subform that is created by an SQL query.  
Under Data Field, you specify the field of the SQL statement whose contents you want to be displayed.  
3rd Case (only in the case of List Boxes):  
For combo boxes, the field of the current form table in which the values entered or selected by the user should be stored is specified under Data Field. (The values displayed in the list of the combo box are based on an SQL statement which is entered under List Contents.)  
4th Case (only in the case of List Boxes):  
The form table does not contain the data to be displayed but rather a table linked to the form table through a common data field.  
If you want a list field to display data from a table that is linked to the current form table, specify the field of the form table that the file content of the list field refers to or the database field that controls the display of the data in the form under Data Field.  
This data field provides the link to the other table if both tables can be linked through a common data field.  
It is usually a data field in which unique identification numbers are stored. (The data field whose contents is to be displayed in the form is specified by an SQL statement under List Contents.)  
List boxes work with references.  
They can either be implemented with linked tables by SQL statements (4th Case) or through value lists:  
References through linked tables (SQL statements)  
If you want a list field to display data of a database table that is linked to the table on which the form is based by a common data field, the link field of the form table is specified under Data Field.  
The link is done with a SQL Select, which, in the case of the selected option "SQL" or "Native SQL", is specified under Type of List Contents in the field List Contents.  
If customer names (managed in the "Customer" table) are to be displayed in the form (associated table: "Order"), the SQL statement can read as follows:  
SELECT CustomerName, CustomorNo FROM Customers,  
where "CustomerName" is the data field from the linked table "Customers" and "CustomerNo" is the field of the table "Customers" that is linked to the field of the form table specified under Data Field.  
References Using Value Lists  
For list boxes, you can use value lists.  
Value lists are lists that define reference values.  
This way, the control in the form does not directly display the content of a database field but rather values assigned in the value list.  
If you work with reference values of a value list, you do not see the contents of the data field that you specified under Data Field in the form but rather the assigned values:  
If you chose the "Value List" option on the Data tab under Type of List Contents and assigned a reference value to the visible list entries in the form under List Contents (which you enter in the General tab), then the reference values are compared with the data content of the given data field.  
If a reference value corresponds to the content of a data field, the associated list entries are displayed in the form.  
Bound column  
Using an index, specify here the table field or table SQL query linked to the field (provided under Field name).  
The possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  
This property for list fields defines which data field of a linked table is displayed in the form.  
If a list box in the form is to display contents of a table linked to the form table, then define in the Type of List Contents field if the display is determined by an SQL command or the (linked) table is accessed.  
With the Bound Column property, you use an index to specify to which data field of the query or of the table the list field is linked.  
Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  
The property Bound Column makes only sense for forms that are used to access more than one table.  
If the form is based on only one table, the field to be displayed in the form is specified directly under Data Field.  
However, if you want the list field to display data of a table that is linked to the current table over a common data field, the linked data field is defined by the property Bound Column.  
If you selected the "SQL" option under Type of List Contents, for example, the SQL command determines the index to be specified.  
Example:  
If an SQL command of the "SELECT Field1, Field2 FROM tablename" form is specified under List Content, it is:  
Bound column

Events  
In this tab page, you can link certain events, which can occur in a form's control field, with a macro.  
This macro or this event procedure will be then initiated as soon as the event occurs.  
A dialog will open which enables you to select the macro.  
Depending on the control, different events can take place.  
Therefore, only the events that make sense for the control and context currently selected are listed on the Event tab page.  
The following events are defined:  
Before commencing  
This event takes place, before an action is triggered by clicking the control.  
Clicking a Submit button initiates the "send" action, however, the actual "send" process is started only when the "When initiating" event occurs.  
With "Before commencing" you can still veto the process.  
If the linked method sends back FALSE, "When initiating" will not be executed.  
When initiating  
This event occurs when an action is started.  
If, for example, you have a Submit button in your form, the send process represents the action.  
Modified  
This event takes place, when the control loses the focus and the contents of the control were changed since it lost the focus.  
Text modified  
This event takes place if you enter or modify a text in an input field.  
Item status changed  
This event takes place if the status of the control field is changed.  
This event takes place if you select a new entry in a list or a combo box or with a check box or option field if the condition of the control field changes.  
Focus gained  
This event takes place if a control field receives the focus.  
Focus lost  
This event takes place if a control field looses the focus.  
Key typed  
This event occurs when the user presses any key while the control has the focus.  
This event may, for example, be linked to a macro for checking entries.  
Key released  
This event occurs when the user releases any key while the control has the focus.  
Mouse inside  
This event takes place if the mouse is inside the control field.  
Mouse dragged while key pressed  
This event takes place when the mouse is dragged while a key is pressed.  
An example of this is when during drag and drop an additional key determines the modus (move or copy).  
Mouse movement  
This event occurs if the mouse moves over the control.  
Mouse pressed  
This event occurs if the mouse button is pressed while the mouse pointer is on the control.  
Mouse released  
This event occurs if the mouse button is released while the mouse pointer is on the control.  
Mouse outside  
This event takes place, when the mouse is outside the control field.  
Form Properties  
In this dialog you can specify, among others, the data source and the events for the whole form.  
General  
Define the general form properties in this tab page.  
Form means an electronic form with different controls.  
If you create a form for a Web page, the user can enter his or her data here to send it over the Internet.  
The data of the control elements of a form is transmitted to a URL and can be processed there.  
Name  
This name is used to identify the form in the Form Navigator.  
URL  
Here, you specify the URL to which the data of the completed form is to be transmitted.  
Frame  
In this field, define the target frame in which the loaded URL is to appear.  
Type of submission  
Select here the method to transfer the completed form information.  
With the get method, the data of every control is transmitted as an environment variable.  
They are appended to the URL in the form "?Control1=Content1&Control2=Content2&..."; the character string is analyzed by a program on the recipient's server.  
In the case of the post method, a document is created from the content of the form that is sent to the specified URL.  
Submission encoding  
Select the type for encoding the data transfer.  
Data transfer of control information  
When sending a form, all controls available in %PRODUCTNAME are taken into consideration.  
The name of the control and the corresponding value, if available, are transmitted.  
Which values are transmitted in each case depends on the respective control.  
For text fields, the visible entries are transmitted; for list boxes, the selected entries are transmitted; for check boxes and option fields, the associated reference values are transmitted if these fields were activated.  
How this information is transmitted depends on the selected transfer method (get or post) and the coding (URL or multipart).  
If the get method and URL encoding are selected, for example, value pairs in the form<Name>=<Value> are sent.  
In addition to the controls that are recognized in HTML, %PRODUCTNAME offers other controls.  
It should be noted that, for fields with a specific numerical format, the visible values are not transmitted but rather fixed default formats.  
The following table shows how the data of the %PRODUCTNAME -specific controls is transmitted:  
Control  
Value Pair  
Numeric field, currency field  
A decimal separator is always displayed as a period.  
Date field  
The date format is sent in a fixed format (MM-DD-YYYY), regardless of the user's local settings.  
Time field  
The time format is sent in a fixed format (HH:MM:SS), regardless of the user's local settings.  
Pattern field  
The values of pattern fields are sent as text fields, i.e., the value visible in the form is sent.  
Table control  
Of the table control, the individual columns are always transmitted.  
The name of the control, the name of the column, and the value of the column are sent.  
Using the get method with URL encoding, the transmission is done in the form <Name of the table control>.<Name of the column>=<Value>, for example, with the value being dependent on the column.  
Events  
In this tab page, you can assign a macro to certain events which occur in a form.  
If the form has a subform, the subform also reacts to events in the parent form.  
Linking an event with a macro makes sense if you have to repeatedly react to a very specific event in the form in a very specific way.  
To do so, first write a macro that contains all the commands to be executed when the event happens; then assign this macro to the respective event.  
For this purpose, simply click the... button beside the respective event; a dialog will then open where you can select the macro.  
The following actions can be configured individually, i.e. you can use your own dialogs to depict an action:  
Displaying an error message,  
Confirming a delete process (for data records),  
Querying parameters,  
Checking input when saving a data record.  
This means, for example, you can issue a "confirm deletion" request such as "Really delete customer xyz?" when deleting a data record.  
In the following, all events defined for a form that can be linked to a macro are described:  
Before resetting  
This event occurs before a formula is reset.  
The linked macro can, for example, prevent this action by returning "FALSE".  
A formula is reset if one of the following conditions is met:  
The user presses an (HTML) button that is defined as a reset button  
In the last record, for example, the Next Record button may be pressed.  
After resetting  
This event occurs after a formula has been reset.  
Before update  
This event occurs before the control content changed by the user is written into the data source.  
The linked macro can, for example, prevent this action by returning "FALSE".  
After update  
This event occurs after the control content changed by the user has been written into the data source.  
Before Submitting  
This event occurs before the formula data is sent.  
When loading  
This event occurs directly after the formula has been loaded.  
Before reloading  
This event occurs before this formula is reloaded.  
The data content has not yet been refreshed.  
When reloading  
This event occurs directly after this formula has been reloaded.  
The data content has already been refreshed.  
Before unloading  
This event occurs before this formula is unloaded, that is, separated from its data source.  
When unloading  
This event occurs directly after this formula is unloaded, that is, separated from its data source.  
Confirm delete  
This event occurs as soon as data is deleted from the formula.  
The linked macro can, for example, request confirmation in a dialog.  
Before record action  
This event occurs before the current record is changed, for example, by editing, deleting or pasting.  
The linked macro can, for example, request confirmation in a dialog.  
After record action  
This event occurs directly after the current record has been changed, for example, by editing, deleting or inserting.  
Before record change  
This event occurs before the current record pointer is changed, for example, via the Next Record button.  
The linked macro can, for example, prevent this action by returning "FALSE".  
After record change  
This event occurs directly after the current record pointer is changed, for example, via the Next Record button.  
Fill parameter  
This event occurs when the formula to be loaded has parameters that must be filled out.  
The data source of the formula can, for example, be the following SQL command:  
SELECT * FROM address WHERE name=:name  
:name is a parameter that must be filled out when loading.  
The parameter is automatically filled out from the principal formula as long as this is possible.  
If the parameter cannot be filled out, this event is called and a linked macro can fill out the parameter.  
Error occurred  
This event occurs if an error occurs when accessing the data source.  
This applies to formulas, list boxes and combo boxes.  
Data  
On this tab page define the form properties referring to the database that is linked to the form.  
Define here the data source on which the form should be based or if the data from thze form's user can be manipulated.  
Apart from the sort and filter functions, you will also find all the necessary properties to create a subform  
If the form is based on an SQL statement (see Data Source property) the filter and sort functions are available only if the SQL statement refers to a table and is not written in the database's native SQL.  
Database  
Define the database containing the data source to which the form should refer.  
If you click the... button, you call the dialog Open, where you can choose the desired data base.  
Data source  
Determine the data source to be used for the form.  
The data source can be an existing table or a query (previously created in the database) or, it can be defined by an SQL-statement.  
Before you enter a data source you have to define the exact type in Type of data source.  
Forms that have been assigned to a database, that is to say that have been created in the form container of the database by using the command New - Form, will always belong to that database.  
The data source used for these forms cannot be changed at a later point in time.  
This is only possible (and necessary) if you use the floating toolbar Form Functions to convert a "normal" document into a form.  
If you have selected either the option "Table" or "Query" under Type of Data Source, the combo box lists all the exists data sources of this type, i.e. all tables and queries set up in the selected database.  
If you want the form to refer to a query, you first have to select the option "Query" as data source type, so that you can specify a query as the data source.  
You can also enter an SQL statement in the Data Source box, if you have selected the "SQL" option as the data source type.  
This statement is used to create an SQL query, which is used as a basis for generating the form or for defining a subform.  
Type of data source  
Define whether the data source is to be an existing database table or query or if the form is to be generated based on an SQL statement.  
If you choose "Table" or "Query", the form will refer to the existing table or query that you specify under Data Source.  
If you want to create a new query or a subform, then you have to choose the "SQL" option.  
You can then enter the statement for the SQL query or the subform directly in the Data Source box.  
The form is then generated on the basis of the specified statement.  
Analyse SQL statement  
If you choose SQL statement under Data Source, decide if the SQL statement is to be analyzed (yes) or not (no) here.  
Filter  
Enter the required conditions for filtering the data in the form.  
The filter specifications follow SQL-rules without using the WHERE clause.  
For example, if you want to display all records with the "Mike" forename, simply enter in the data field Forename = 'Mike'.  
You can also combine conditions:  
Forename = Mike OR Forename = Peter, all records with these two conditions will be displayed.  
The filter function is available in user mode through the AutoFilter and Standard Filter icons on the form bar.  
Sort  
You can enter the desired conditions to sort the data in the form.  
The specification of the sorting conditions follows SQL rules without the use of the ORDER BY clause.  
For example, if you want all registers of a data base to be sorted on one field in an ascending order and on other field in a descending order, enter (Name of field 1) ASC, (Name of field 2) DESC.  
The appropriate icons on the Forms bar can be used in User mode to sort:  
Sort Ascending, Sort Descending, Sort.  
Add data only  
Determine here if the form should only permit the addition of new data (Yes) or if it should permit other properties (No).  
You can only add data since you can not view the already existing records.  
Navigation  
Decide if the navigation functions in the form bar can be used in the lower margin of the form (Yes) or not (No).  
The "Parent Form" option is used for subforms.  
If you choose this option for a subform you can navigate using the records of the main form if the cursor is placed in the subform.  
Because a subform is linked to the main form by a 1:1 relationship, navigating within the subform does not make any sense.  
The navigation is always completed in the parent form.  
Cycle  
Using the tab key you can move forward in the form.  
If you simultaneously press the Shift key, the Navigation will follow the opposite direction.  
If you reach the last (or the first) field and press again the the tab key, it can have various effects.  
Define the key control with the following options:  
Option  
Meaning  
Default  
If the form contains a database link, the Tab key will, by default, initiate a change to the next or previous record on exit from the last field (see All Records).  
If there is no database link the next/previous form is shown (see Current Page).  
All Records  
This option applies to database forms only and is used to navigate through all records.  
The current record is changed on exit from the last field of a form via the Tab key.  
Current Record  
Similarly, this option applies to database forms only and is used to navigate within the current record.  
The current record is kept on exit from the last field of a form via the Tab key.  
Current Page  
On exit from the last field of a form the cursor skips to the first field in the next form.  
This is standard for HTML forms; therefore, this option is especially relevant for HTML forms.  
Allow additions  
Determine if data can be added (Yes) or not (No).  
Allow modifications  
Determine here if the data can be modified (Yes) or not (No).  
Allow deletions  
Determine here if the data can be deleted (Yes) or not (No).  
Link master fields  
If you create a subform, enter here the data field of the parent form responsible of the synchronization between parent and subform.  
If you would like to enter various values, press Command Ctrl + Enter key after each input line.  
The subform is based on a SQL query; more specifically, on a Parameter Query.  
If a field name is entered in the Link master fields field, the data contained in that field in the main form are read to a variable that you must enter in Link slave fields.  
In an appropriate SQL statement, this variable is compared to the table data the subform refers to.  
This procedure determines the type of display in the subform.  
Consider the following example:  
The database table on which the form is based is, for example, a customer database ("Customer"), where every customer has been given a unique number in a data field named "Cust_ID".  
A customer's orders are maintained in another database table.  
You now want to see each customer's orders after entering them into the form.  
In order to do this you should create a subform and under Link master fields enter the data field from the customer database which clearly identifies the customer, i.e. "Cust_ID" (without quotes).  
Under Link slave fields enter the name of a variable which is to accept the data of the field Cust_ID, e.g. "x".  
The subform should show the appropriate data from the orders table ("Orders") for each customer or customer ID (Customer_ID -> x).  
Of course this is only possible if each order is uniquely assigned to one customer in the orders table.  
Alternatively, you can use a field called "Cust_ID"; to make sure that this field is not confused with the field from the main form (which we will assume is called "Customer_ID").  
Now you simply compare the "Cust_ID" in the "Orders" table with the "Customer_ID" from the "Customers" table, which can be done using the x variable, e.g. with the following SQL statement:  
SELECT * FROM Order WHERE Cust_ID =: x (if you want the subform to show all data from the orders table)  
or:  
SELECT Item FROM Orders WHERE Cust_ID =: x (if you want the subform from the orders table to show only the data contained in the "Item" field)  
The SQL statement can either be entered in the Data Source field, or you can create an appropriate parameter query, which can be used to create the subform.  
Link slave fields  
If you create a subform, enter here the variable where possible values from the parent form field can be stored.  
If a subform is based on an existing query, enter here the variable that you defined in the query.  
If you create a form using an SQL statement, entered in the Data source field, enter the variable you use in the statement.  
You can freely choose the variable name.  
If you want to enter various values, press Command Ctrl + Enter.  
If, for example, you specified the "CustomerID" database field as a parent field under Link master fields, then you can define under Link slave fields the name of the variable in which the values of the "CustomerID" database field are to be read.  
If you now specify an SQL statement in the Data Source box using this variable, the relevant values are displayed in the subform.  
What is a subform?  
Forms are created based on a database table or database query.  
They display the data in a graphical fashion and can be used to enter new data or change existing data which is then stored in the database table or query used as the basis of the form.  
Should you require a form, which not simply refers to the data in a table or query but which is also to display data in another table, then you can create a subform in your form.  
This subform may comprise a text box, for example, which records the data of a second database table.  
A subform is nothing more than an "additional component of the main form".  
The "main form" is termed the "superior form".  
When created, it is based on a database table containing the more important form data, all the other data administered in a database table is used to form an additional component: the subform.  
Subform are also needed as soon as you want to access more than one table from a form.  
Each table requires its own subform.  
A subform is seen as such by the user.  
The user only sees a form in which data is entered or where existing data is displayed.  
Using this form and subforms, it is possible to generate a simple customized input mask for the user, irrespective of how the data is managed in the database.  
Tab Order  
In this dialog you can modify the order in which control fields should be focused with the tab key.  
If form elements are inserted into a document, %PRODUCTNAME automatically determines in which order to jump from one control to the next when using the Tab key.  
Every new control added is automatically placed at the end of this series.  
In the Tab Order dialog, you can adapt the order of this series to your individual needs.  
You can also define the index of a control through its specific properties by entering the desired value under Order in the Properties dialog of the control.  
Controls  
These controls can be selected with the tab key.  
Select here a control to assign the desired position in the tab order.  
Move Up  
Click this button to shift the selected control one position higher in the tab order.  
Move Down  
Click this button to demote the selected control one position in the tab order.  
Automatic Sort  
Click this button to automatically sort the controls to focus them using the tab key.  
The automatic sort will orientate according to the control's position in the document.  
Field selection  
Click this icon to open a window where you can select the database field to add to the form.  
The field selection window lists all database fields of the table (or query) which you gave as the data source in the Form Properties.  
You can incorporate a field into the current document by dragging and dropping it into the document while holding down the mouse button.  
A corresponding field is then set up in the document with a link to the database.  
If you switch off the Design Mode, you can see that %PRODUCTNAME set up a labeled input field for every inserted database field where the user can enter the data.  
Design Mode  
Click this icon to toggle the Design mode on or off.  
In the Design mode you can define the form layout.  
If the mode is not active, form controls cannot be edited.  
This function is used to switch quickly between Design and User mode.  
When you design a form, you can change the mode, for example, to check the form created so far.  
Please note the Open in Design Mode function.  
If this command is activated, the document is always opened in Design mode, regardless of the state in which it is saved.  
If you do not want the final form to be opened in the Design mode by the user, you can deactivate this command.  
If your form is linked to a database and you turn off the Design mode, the form bar is displayed at the lower margin of the document window.  
You can edit the link to the database in the Form Properties.  
Form Navigator  
The Form Navigator displays all forms and subforms of the current document with their respective controls.  
When using several forms, the Form Navigator not only gives an overview of them but also provides various functions for editing a form.  
In the form navigator you see a list of all created (logical) forms with the corresponding control fields.  
You can see if a form contains control fields by the plus sign displayed before the entry.  
Click the plus sign to open the list of the form elements.  
Select one or more controls and drag them into another form.  
The description can also be edited in the Navigator by simply clicking an entry and changing the description.  
If you select a control with your mouse in the Form Navigator, the corresponding element is selected in the document.  
This way, you can easily navigate within the form.  
If you call the context menu of a selected entry, the Navigator offers you different functions:  
New  
This command offers functions to add new elements to the form.  
These functions can only be called if a form is selected in the Navigator.  
Form  
With this command you can create a new form.  
To create a new submenu in the selected form, mark a form entry.  
Creates in the selected formula a hidden control that is not visible on screen and thus is hidden from the user.  
A hidden control serves to include data that is transmitted together with the formula.  
It contains additional information or clarifying text that you can specify when creating the formula via the Special Properties of the control.  
Select the entry of the hidden control in the Formula Navigator and select the Properties command.  
Normally you can copy controls in the document view through the clipboard (shortcut keys (command) (Ctrl) (C) for copying and (command) (Ctrl) (V) for inserting).  
This is naturally impossible to do with hidden controls since they are not visible in the document view.  
However, you can copy hidden controls in the Formula Navigator by using drag & drop: drag the hidden control using the mouse while keeping (command) (Ctrl) key pressed.  
You drop it in any formula, even the formula where the hidden control is already located.  
Drag and drop to copy controls within the same document or between documents.  
Open another form document and drag the hidden control from the Form Navigator into the Form Navigator of the target document.  
Click a visible control directly in the document, rest the mouse for a moment so that a copy of the control is added to the drag and drop clipboard, then drag the copy into the other document.  
If you want a copy in the same document, press Ctrl while dragging.  
Delete  
Deletes the selected entry.  
This allows you to delete individual form components as well as whole forms with one mouse click.  
Tab order  
When a form is selected, it opens the Tab Order dialog where the indices for focusing the control elements on the Tab key are defined.  
Properties  
Starts the Properties dialog for the selected entry.  
If a formula is selected, the Formula Properties dialog opens, with a selected control of the dialog for Control Properties.  
HTML Filters and Forms  
You can now use all control element and form events in HTML documents.  
There have been numerous events to date (e.g. the focus events), which have not been changed at all.  
They will continue to be imported and exported as ONFOCUS, ONBLUR, etc. for JavaScript and as SDONFOCUS, SDONBLUR, etc. for %PRODUCTNAME Basic.  
An event registered as XListener::method is exported as  
SDEvent-XListener-method = "/* event-code * /"  
The XListener- and method components of this option are case sensitive!  
Event handling of controls is performed using the %PRODUCTNAME API.  
If you assign an event to a control, an object registers itself internally as a "Listener" for a specific control event.  
To do this, the object must use a specific interface, for example the XFocusListener Interface, so that it can react to focus events.  
When the event occurs, the control then invokes a special method of the Listener interface, for example focusGained, when the control receives the focus.  
The internally registered object then invokes the JavaScript or %PRODUCTNAME Basic code, which was assigned to the event.  
The HTML filter now uses precisely these listener interfaces and method names so that it can import and export events as desired.  
Thus you can register a focus event via  
<INPUT TYPE=text ONFOCUS="/* code * / "  
rather than via  
<INPUT TYPE=text SDEvent-XFocusListener-focusGained="/* code * / "  
Events can thus be registered as desired, including those not offered in the list boxes.  
To define the script language of events, you may write the following line in the document header:  
<META HTTP-EQUIV="content-script-type "CONTENT="...">  
As CONTENT you can, for example, use "text/x-StarBasic" for %PRODUCTNAME Basic or a "text/JavaScript" for JavaScript.  
If no entry is made, JavaScript is assumed.  
During exporting, the default script language will be defined based on the first module found in macro management.  
Thus (for events) only one language can be used per document.  
Table Element AutoPilot  
If you insert a table control in a document, the Table Element AutoPilot starts automatically.  
In this AutoPilot, you can interactively specify which information is displayed in the table control.  
You can use the AutoPilot on/off icon to keep the AutoPilot from starting automatically.  
AutoPilot Table Element / List Box / Combo Box:  
Data  
Select the data source and table to which the form field relates.  
If you insert the form field in a document that is already linked to a data source, this page becomes invisible.  
Data source  
In this field select the data source that contains the desired table.  
Table  
Select the table in this field.  
AutoPilot Table Element:  
Field Selection  
Select here which fields in the table control field should be displayed.  
Selected Fields  
You see here the data fields that are accepted into the form field.  
AutoPilot Combo Box/List Box  
If you insert a combo box or a list box in a document, an AutoPilot starts automatically.  
This AutoPilot allows you to interactively specify which information is shown.  
You can use the AutoPilot on/off icon to keep the AutoPilot from starting automatically.  
The AutoPilots for combo boxes and list boxes differ from one another in their final step.  
This has to do with the nature of control fields:  
List Boxes  
In the case of a list box, the user selects one entry from a list of entries.  
These entries are saved in a database table and cannot be modified via the list box.  
As a general rule, the database table that contains the list entries that are visible in the form is not the table on which the form is based.  
Thus the list boxes of a given form work by using references, i.e. references to the visible list entries are located in the form table (values table) and are also entered as such in the values table if the user selects an entry from the list and saves it.  
Via reference values, list boxes can display data from a table linked to the current form table.  
Thus the List Box AutoPilot allows two tables of a database to be linked, so that the control field can display a detailed list of a database field that is located in a different table from the one to which the form refers.  
In the other tables the required field is searched for by using the field names (ControlSource) and then the fields will be completed accordingly.  
If the field name is not found the list will remain empty.  
When list fields contain linked columns the first column of the other table will be used without a query being shown first.  
If an article table contains, for example, the number of a supplier, the list box can use the 'supplier number' link to display the name of the supplier from the supplier table.  
On the Field links page the AutoPilot will ask you about all the settings required for this link.  
Combo Boxes  
In the case of combo boxes, users can select one entry from the list entries or enter text themselves.  
The entries, which are offered as a list from which users may select, may originate from any database table.  
The entries that users select or enter so that they can be saved can be saved either in the form only or in a database.  
If they are saved in a database, they will be written to the database table on which the form is based.  
A direct link between the current form table and the table whose values are to be displayed in the combo box (list table) is not required.  
Combo boxes do not work with references.  
If the user enters or selects a value and saves it, the value actually displayed will be entered in the form table.  
As there is no link between the form table and the list table, the Field Link table does not appear here.  
In the case of a combo box, you can add additional text that can be written to the current database table of the form (values table) and stored there as desired.  
For this function, the Combo Box AutoPilot has the Data Processing page as the last page, whereas in the case of list boxes this page does not exist.  
Here you can enter whether and where text that has been entered is to be saved in the values table.  
AutoPilot Combo Box / List Box:  
Table Selection  
From the database available tables, select here a table containing the data field and whose content should be displayed as a list entry.  
A table that can be linked with the current form table is indicated here for list boxes.  
This makes it possible to establish an unambiguous reference.  
For combo boxes, there must be a relationship between the form table and the table containing the data to be displayed in the combo box.  
Table for list contents  
In this field, select the table containing the data field and whose content should be displayed in the control field.  
The table given here appears in the Control properties as an element of an SQL statement in the List Contents field.  
AutoPilot Combo/List Box:  
Field Selection  
Select here the data field specified in the table on previous page, whose contents should be displayed in the list or combo box.  
Available Fields  
Here you can see all the table fields chosen on the previous AutoPilot page.  
Display Field  
Here enter the field whose data are to be shown in the combo or list boxes.  
The field name given here appears in the Control properties as an element of an SQL statement in the List Contents field.  
AutoPilot list field:  
Field link  
Here you indicate via which fields, tables of values and list tables are linked.  
The list table is the table whose data should be shown in the list field.  
Both tables must be linked over a mutual data field.  
These links are to be entered on this page of the AutoPilot.  
The field names must not necessarily be the same (this depends upon how the field names are defined in both tables), but both fields must have the same field type.  
Value table field  
Enter here the current form data field which should be related to a field in the linked table.  
In addition, click the desired data field in the list field below.  
In Control - Properties, the specified field will appear as entry in the Data tab page under Data field.  
List table field  
Enter here the linked table data field which is related to the specified value table field.  
In addition, click the data field in the lower list field.  
In Control - Properties, the specified field will appear in the Data tab page of a SQL statement under List Contents.  
AutoPilot combo box: database field  
With the combination fields, you can either save the value of a field in a database or display this value in a form.  
This is especially helpful in HTML forms, where the user's entered or selected values should be assigned to a server.  
Do you want to save the value in a database field?  
Two options are available to answer this question:  
Yes, in the following database field  
Select this option, if the user's entered or selected combination field value should be saved in a database field.  
Several database table fields are offered which can be accessed in the current form.  
In Control - Properties the selected field appears as entry in the Data tab page under Data field.  
List field  
Select here the data field where the combination field value should be saved.  
No, I only want to display the value  
With this option, the value of this combination field will not be written in the database and will only be saved in the form.  
Open in Design Mode  
Choose this command to open the form when the document is opened in the design mode.  
You can then edit the form, but you cannot use any buttons in the document or select entries from list boxes.  
Remove the command after your form is fully developed, and resave it.  
Now, you can open and use all interactive form objects.  
If the document is write-protected this command is ignored, i.e. the Design Mode is not automatically activated when the document is opened.  
This is the case for database forms because these forms are write-protected by default.  
AutoPilot On/Off  
With this icon you control automatic starting of the AutoPilot when inserting a new control.

Text fields are sorted alphabetically (Z-A), number fields in numerically descending order (9-0).  
Sort Ascending  
AutoFilter  
The AutoFilter function filters the records based on the content of the currently selected data field.  
AutoFilter  
Place the cursor in a field name whose content you want to filter and then click the AutoFilter icon.  
Now you will see only those records with content identical to the selected field name.  
For example, to view all the customers from Hamburg, click a field name with the entry "Hamburg".  
AutoFilter then filters all customers from Hamburg from the database for you.  
You can remove the current AutoFilter with the Remove Filter/Sorting icon.  
To filter with several field names simultaneously, you can bring up a dialog with the Default Filter... icon where you can combine several filter criteria.  
Remove Filter/Sorting  
Use this function to remove all of the AutoFilters and sort options that were set.  
Remove Filter/Sorting  
You can undo all query criteria again in Query Design.  
A form-based filter will be deleted entirely.  
Refresh  
Click this icon to update the data displayed.  
This can be helpful, for example, if you access databases of common use in a network and want to view the current content of the database.  
Refresh  
A long click on the icon opens a submenu with the following commands:  
Refresh - Shows the updated contents of the database table.  
Use this command when you have changed the structure of the table.  
Insert Database Columns  
Here all fields of the marked record are inserted in the current document at the cursor position.  
The icon is only visible if the current document is a text document or a spreadsheet.  
For further information on this point see %PRODUCTNAME Writer or %PRODUCTNAME Calc Help.  
Insert Text  
In the data source browser, select the record which you want to insert in the document and then click the Data to Text icon.  
The record is inserted in the document at the cursor position, with the contents of each individual field of the record being copied to a table column.  
You can also select multiple records and transfer them into the document by clicking the icon.  
Each individual record is then written to a new row.  
In the data source browser, select the records which you want to insert in the document and then click the Data to Text icon.  
This opens the dialog Insert Database Columns.  
This dialog is also opened when you insert data from a database by drag and drop from the data source browser into the document, because you first have to state in the dialog whether the data should be inserted as a table, as fields or as text.  
The preferences you set in this dialog for inserting data are saved and will be active the next time the dialog is called.  
This save process is independent of the database and can record the preferences for a maximum of 5 databases.  
If data is inserted into the document as a table, the table properties are not saved along with the data in the document.  
This template will then be used automatically if you insert data as table automatically again, unless the preferences have been changed.  
Table  
Here you can insert data selected in the data source browser in the document as a table.  
In the dialog Insert Database Columns, select the Table option to insert the selected data in the document as a table.  
In the dialog you can decide which database fields or columns should be transferred and how the text table should be formatted.  
Table  
In the Table area, use the arrow keys to select the columns of the database table you want to apply to the text table.  
Database columns  
All database table columns, which have not been accepted in the Table list box, are listed here.  
The entries are sorted alphabetically.  
Select the database column whose content you want to insert in the text table.  
Table  
The Table list box lists all selected database columns to insert them in the document.  
A column will be assigned to each entry in the table to be inserted in the document.  
The entry order in the Table list box will determine the data order in the text table.  
=>>  
Click this button to accept all database fields and insert them in the document.  
->  
Click this button to accept the selected database field in the Table list box.  
You can also double click an entry to accept it in the Table list box.  
<-  
Click this button if you do not want the selected database field (in the Table list box) to be accepted in the text table.  
<<=  
Click this button to remove all database fields from the Table list box.  
Table heading  
Specify the text table header settings here.  
Table heading  
Mark this check box to insert a heading line for the columns in the text table.  
Apply column name  
With this option the field names of the database table will be taken as headings for each of the text table columns.  
Create only row  
With this option, an empty heading line will be inserted in the text table.  
With this option, you can define the headings in the document, which do not correspond to the names of the database field.  
Format  
Specify the format in which the contents of the database fields are to be inserted into the document.  
From database  
Select this option to accept the database formats.  
Select  
If the format information of certain data fields is not accepted, select then a format from the selection list in which the field contents should be inserted in the document.  
The number formats supplied here are only available for certain database fields, for example, numeric or boolean fields.  
If you select a database field in text format, you will not be able to select any format from the selection list since the text format will be automatically maintained.  
If the format you want is not listed, select "Other Formats..." and define the desired format in the Number Format dialog.  
The number format assigned using the selection list always refers to the database field selected in the Database Columns list box.  
You can then select a database field from the Table list box to define the formatting of the database field.  
It does not matter whether the database field was selected from the Database Columns list box or from the Table list box.  
Properties...  
Click this button to access the Table Format dialog, which enables you to define the table properties.  
You can define, for example, borders, background, alignment, column width, etc.  
AutoFormat...  
This button opens the AutoFormat dialog to automatically format the table.  
In this dialog, you can select a format style, which will be immediately applied when inserting the table.  
Fields  
Select this option if fields should be inserted in the document for the data selected in the data source browser.  
If you select the Fields option in the Insert Database Columns dialog, Fields will be inserted in the document for the data selected in the data source browser.  
These database fields work as wildcards for the individual database columns and can be used for form letters.  
Click the Data in Fields icon to match the contents of the fields to the currently selected record.  
If several records are selected when you choose the Data in Text function, the mail merge fields will be inserted according to the number of records.  
Furthermore, a field command like "Next record" will be inserted automatically between individual field command blocks inserted into the document.  
The Insert Database Columns dialog lets you define which database fields to insert into the document and how to format the paragraphs.  
Fields  
In the Fields area, use the arrow button to select the database table columns into which you want to insert field contents.  
Database columns  
This list box lists all columns of the database table, which can be accepted in the selection list box to insert them in the document.  
Select the database column, which you want to insert it in the document.  
=>  
Click this button to accept the entry, you selected in the Database columns list box, in the selection field.  
You can also double click the entry to select it.  
Select  
The selection field lists the database columns that you selected to insert them in the document.  
This text will be also inserted in the document.  
The entries' order in the selection field corresponds to the data order in the document.  
For example, if you insert a line break with the Enter key, in the same way, a (paragraph) break will be inserted in the same position in the document.  
Paragraph Style  
By default, the inserted paragraphs are formatted with the current Paragraph Styles.  
This format corresponds to the "none" entry in the Paragraph Style list box.  
This is where you can select other Paragraph Styles to apply in the paragraph you want to insert in the document.  
The list box presents the available Paragraph Styles defined in %PRODUCTNAME and managed in the Style Catalog.  
Text  
Select this option if the data selected in the data source browser should be inserted in the document as text.  
If you select the Text option in the Insert Database Columns dialog, the content of the data selected in the data source browser will be inserted in the document as text.  
You specify in the dialog which field contents should be inserted from the database into the document and how the paragraphs should be formatted.  
If several records are selected when you choose the Data in Text function, the mail merge fields will be inserted according to the number of records.  
Text  
In the Text area, use the arrow button to select the database table columns into which you want to insert field contents.  
Update Fields  
Here the contents of the existing database fields will be updated by the marked records.  
The icon can only be seen if the current document is a text document.  
Update Fields  
Default Filter  
This icon calls the Filter dialog, which enables you to enter the filter criteria for the data display.  
While you can only filter based on one criterion with the AutoFilter function, you can combine several criteria in this dialog.  
Default Filter...  
If you use the AutoFilter function before displaying the Filter dialog to automatically filter according to a selected field, the filter that is already set will then be displayed when calling up the Filter dialog.  
If at the same time you selected a special field within the filtered records, when you open the Filter dialog this additional selection will be correctly displayed by an AND operator. %PRODUCTNAME interprets your selection according to the logic "filtered records" AND "selection", since you looked for a record within the filtered records.  
When you open the Filter dialog, all the filters that have already been set are displayed. %PRODUCTNAME recognizes a selection you have made and shows you the correct interpretation in the Filter dialog.  
You can of course change the filter conditions automatically set by %PRODUCTNAME in the Filter dialog, so as to carry out a new filter.  
You can remove the current filter with the Remove Filter/Sorting icon.  
Filter  
Specify in this dialog the logical conditions to filter your table data.  
This dialog is called Standard Filter in Spreadsheet documents, Filter in database tables or database forms.  
The Filter dialog doesn't contain the More button.  
Filter criteria  
You can define a default filter by indicating the type of line, the name of the field, a logical condition and a value or a combination of arguments.  
Operator  
For the following arguments, you can choose between the logical operators AND / OR.  
Field name  
From the list box, select the field names from the current table to set them in the argument.  
You will see here the column identifiers if no text is available for the field names.  
Condition  
From this list box, you can select among various comparative operators through which the entries in the Field name and Value fields can be linked.  
Value  
Enter a value to filter the field.  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheets contain a list box with all possible values performed in the Field name column.  
Here you can select "empty" or "full", to specify empty or filled entries.  
If you use the filter function in database tables or forms, then enter the value in the text box to be used for filtering.  
More>>  
Comparison Operators  
The following comparative operators can be set under Condition in the Default Filter dialog.  
Comparative operator

Sort  
Sort  
Sort  
Enter here the sort criteria for the data display.  
While the functions Sort in Ascending Order and Sort in Descending Order sort by one criterion only, you can combine several criteria in this dialog.  
You can remove a sorting that has been performed with the Remove Filter/Sorting icon.  
Sorting  
Use this area to enter search criteria.  
If you enter additional sorting criteria under And Then, the data matching the content of the higher-order criterion will then be ordered according to the next criterion.  
If you sort the field name "First name" in ascending order and the field name "last name" in descending order, all records will be sorted in ascending order by first name, and then within the first names, in descending order by last name.  
Field name  
Select here the data field name whose content will determine the sort order.  
Order  
Specify here the sort order (either ascending or descending).  
then  
Enter additional subordinate sort criteria into the other fields.  
Browsing for Records  
Click this icon to search for a specific value in data fields.  
In forms or database tables, you can search through data fields, lists fields and check boxes for specific values.  
When searching a table, the data fields of the current table are searched.  
When searching in the form, the data fields of the table linked with the form are searched.  
The search described here is carried out by %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you want to use the SQL server to search in a database, then you should use the icon Form based filter contained in the Form bar.  
The search function is also available for table controls.  
When calling the search function when a table control is selected you can search each column of the table control corresponding to the database columns of the linked database table.  
Search for  
This is where you choose what you want to look for.  
Text:  
Enter the search term in the combo box or select it from the list.  
If the cursor is in a field containing simple text (without tabs and line breaks) when the dialog is called up, the selected entry will be automatically entered into the text box of the Find dialog.  
Please note, while running a search in a form, tabs and line breaks cannot be processed.  
Several search terms will be saved as long as the table or the formula document is open.  
If you are running more than one search and you would like to repeat the search term, you can select an already used search term from the list box.  
Field content is NULL  
If this option has been selected a search will be made for fields that do not have any content.  
Field content is not NULL  
If this option has been selected then fields will be found that contain data.  
area  
You can determine the fields in this area for the search.  
Form  
This is where you specify the logical form in which you want the search to take place.  
This combo box is only visible if the current document is a form document with more than one logical form.  
It does not appear during a search in tables or queries.  
Form documents may contain multiple logical forms.  
These are individual form components, which are each linked to a table.  
Imagine that you have a form (linked to table A) with a subform (linked to table B).  
Parent and subform are each logical forms.  
Your form document therefore consists of two logical forms.  
The combo box contains the names of all logical forms for which controls exist.  
By default, the logical form is selected in which the control selected was when you accessed the dialog.  
All Fields  
Select this option to search through all fields.  
If you are running a search in a form, all fields of the logical form (entered under Form) will be searched through.  
If you are running a search in a table control field, all columns, which are linked to a valid database table field, will be searched through.  
Please note that the fields of the current logical form do not have to be identical to the fields of the form document.  
If the form document contains fields that point to multiple data sources (i.e. to multiple logical forms), the All fields option will only search for the fields linked to data sources in the form document.  
Single field  
By selecting this option, you can search through a specific data field.  
Settings  
Here you can make a number of settings to control the search.  
Position  
Enter the relationship of the search term and the field contents here.  
The following options are available:  
Anywhere in the field  
Returns all fields containing the search pattern anywhere in the field, at the beginning, at the end or in the center of the field.  
Beginning of field  
Returns all fields containing the search pattern at the beginning of the field  
End of field  
Returns all fields containing the search pattern at the end of the field.  
Entire field  
Returns all fields containing the search pattern as an exact match to the contents of the field.  
If the Wildcard expression check box is marked, this function is not available.  
Apply field format  
If you mark this check box, all field formats will be considered in the current document.  
Field formats are all visible formats, which were created using the following possibilities:  
in table design for field properties,  
in data view on column formatting,  
in forms on control properties.  
If you want to search through the data in a table or form in the data view, you can choose to consider the formatting currently shown or the default database formatting during the search.  
If the Apply field format check box is marked, the data view of the table or form is searched using the formatting set there; if it is not marked, the database is searched using the formatting saved in the database.  
Example:  
17.02.65).  
For example, select the "TT.  
After editing the field formatting, a record containing February 17 is only returned with the following settings:  
Apply field format  
Search Pattern  
on  
"Feb" is returned, but not "2".  
off  
"2" is returned, but not "Feb".  
Otherwise (internal) field formatting is considered, which may lead to undesirable search results.  
The following examples show possible issues when searching without field formatting.  
These issues depend on the database used and only occur for certain internal default formatting:  
Search Results  
Cause  
"5" returns "14:00:00" as a time  
Time fields are not defined for dBase databases and must be simulated.  
To internally display the time "14:00:00", a 5 is necessary.  
"00:00:00" returns all records of straight date fields  
The database stores a date value internally using a combined date/time field.  
"45.79" does not return "45.79" although the Entire field option is selected under Position.  
The view shown does not match what is stored internally.  
For example, if value 45.789 is stored in the database as a field of type Number/Double and the shown formatting is set to display only two digits following the decimal point, "45.79" is only returned in searches with field formatting.  
In this case, default formatting is formatting, which refers to the internally stored data.  
They are not always visible to the user - especially if they are used for simulating data types (e.g. time fields in dBase databases).  
This depends on the database used and the individual data type.  
It is simply important to know that you are "always on the safe side" when searching with field formatting if you only want to find what is actually shown.  
This specifically includes fields of type Date, Time, Date/Time and Number/Double.  
Searching without field formatting, however, can be very useful because there is an advantage: you can accelerate the search.  
Therefore, you can select this search option for larger databases if there are no formatting issues.  
If you are searching "with field format" in check boxes, you will receive a "1" for markded check boxes, a "0" for unmarked ones and an empty string for undefined (in gray) ones.  
If the search has been carried out without Apply field format, you will see language-dependent default values "TRUE" or "FALSE".  
If you use "with field format" when searching in list fields you will find the text displayed in list fields, "without field format" you will find the contents corresponding to the normal field format.  
Match case  
With match case, upper and lower case are taken into consideration.  
Search backwards  
Mark this check box to invert the search direction.  
If this check box is marked, the search process will run in reverse direction (from the last to the first record).  
From top / bottom  
Mark this check box to restart the search.  
In a backwards search (mark the Search backwards check box) it will restart with the last record.  
Mark this check box to repeat a search, not to continue one.  
A new or repeat search always starts with the first or last record.  
Wildcard expression  
Mark this check box if you want to search with a * or? wildcard.  
Mark this check box if the search term contains a wildcard.  
You can use the following wildcards:  
Wildcards  
Meaning  
Example  
?  
for exactly one arbitrary character  
"?loppy" returns "Floppy"  
"M?ller" returns, e.g., Miller and Moller  
*  
for 0 or more arbitrary characters  
"*-*" returns "ZIP-Drive" and "CD-ROM"  
Miller, Moller, Mather)  
If you want to search for the actual wildcards "?" or "*" enter them with a backslash, i.e. "\?" or "\*" (without quotation marks), so that the question mark or the star are searched for.  
However, this is only necessary when you search with a wildcard.  
In "normal" mode, the wildcard characters are processed like regular characters.  
Regular expression  
This check box permits a search with regular expressions.  
In regular expressions, certain characters can be used which control the search process.  
These characters can be characters used as wildcards or characters defining a specific search.  
The same regular expressions that are supported here are also supported in the %PRODUCTNAME Find & Replace dialog.  
The latter, however, is typically sufficient in normal usage and can be handled more easily.  
If you search for regular terms, the following characters correspond to those used in searches with wildcards:  
Search with wildcards  
Search for regular terms  
?  
.  
*  
.*  
Status  
The Status Bar shows the current record returned by the search.  
If the search reaches the end (or the beginning) of the table, the search is automatically continued at the beginning (or the end).  
Depending on the search direction, an appropriate message appears.  
In very large databases, finding the record in reverse search order can take some time.  
In this case, the status bar informs you that the records are still being counted.  
Search / Cancel  
Use this button to start or cancel the search.  
With the Search button, you will start a search.  
If the search is successfully completed, the corresponding field will be highlighted.  
You can continue the search process by clicking again the Search button or with the At the beginning or At the end setting.  
You can cancel a search process by clicking the Cancel button.  
To end the search, click the Close button.  
Close  
The settings of the last search process will be adopted and will be preserved until you end the %PRODUCTNAME program.  
If several tables or forms are open, set individual search options for each document.  
Then close the documents one at a time, and the search options of the document last closed are saved.  
Form-based Filters  
Use this icon to prompt the database server to filter the visible data by specified criteria.  
Unlike the normal search which is called up by the icon Find Record... on the form bar, you can search much faster by using the form-based filter (as usually a quick database server is charged with the search) and entering more complex search conditions.  
Form-based Filters  
Apply Filter  
This is where you switch between the filtered and unfiltered view.  
If the icon has been pressed down then the filtered view is shown, similarly the unfiltered view is seen when the icon has not been pressed down.  
A gray icon denotes that filters have not been defined.  
Apply Filter  
This function retains form-based filters that have been set which means that you do not have to redefine them everytime you wish to use them.  
Data source as table  
This icon is used to switch on and off the additional view of the table when in the form view.  
If the icon is pressed down you will see the table in a frame at the upper edge of the form.  
If the icon is not pressed down you will only see the form.  
Data source as table  
The table and the form are almost completely equal in this common view.  
That means that you can see a data record selected in the table in the form and that alterations to the table will be visible in the table and vice versa.  
If there are several logical forms in a document, the table will only be able to show one at a time.  
You are able to move the Frame border of the additional table view by mouse.  
By Crtl + double click in a free area of the docked frame you can change it into a floating window.  
If you Crtl + double click again the frame will be redocked to its last position.  
Dividing the view between form and table is also available if you have created your own form based on text, spreadsheet or presentation documents by using the Form Functions floating toolbar.  
If this should be the case you will see each group of option fields, for example, as a pull-down list in the table view of your form.  
Data Source of Current Document  
Here you show, in the data source browser, the table that is linked to the current document.  
Data Source of Current Document  
Choose Edit - Exchange database to select another table.  
Set tabs  
On the ruler, set the tabs for the current paragraph or all selected paragraphs using the mouse.  
The default tabs have a spacing of 2 cm on the horizontal ruler.  
Once you set a tab, only the default tabs to the right of the tab you set are available.  
Set indents, margins, and columns  
You can determine the indents and margins for the current paragraph or for all selected paragraphs using the mouse.  
If you split the page into columns or the cursor is placed in multiple-column text frame, you can freely change the column width and the column spacing on the ruler by dragging it with the mouse.  
When an object, an image, or a text element is active, you will see the borders of this element and you can change them by dragging them in the ruler with the mouse.  
If the cursor is placed in a table cell, you can drag the indents for the contents of the cell as well as the boundary lines to change the distribution of the table columns.  
These icons mark the left indent for the first line of the current paragraph (top triangle) and the left indent for the other lines of the paragraph (bottom triangle).  
This icon on the right of the ruler marks the right indent of the current paragraph.  
Task  
Procedure  
Set left indent  
Drag the bottom left mark to the right while pressing the mouse button  
Set left indent of first line  
Drag the top left mark to the right while pressing the mouse button  
Set right indent  
Drag the mark on the right to the left while pressing the mouse button  
In order to change the left indent starting only with the second line of a paragraph, hold down the (Command) (Ctrl) key, click the triangle on the bottom left, and drag it to the right while holding the key.  
Tabs that might be set are not changed when indenting a paragraph.  
If the set tabs end up outside the margins of the paragraph, they are no longer displayed but they are not lost.  
Run  
Click this icon to see the query result.  
Clicking the Run icon runs the SQL query and displays the query result.  
However, the query is not yet saved.  
This function is useful if you want to check the query once more, e.g. to modify it if necessary.  
When you finally save the query, it is stored in the Query folder.

If it is not pressed, you see the SQL view.  
Turning design view on and off  
Native SQL  
In Native SQL mode you enter SQL commands which are not interpreted by %PRODUCTNAME, but instead are passed directly to the data source.  
If you do not display these changes in the design view, you cannot change back to the design view.  
For native SQL, the SQL string is forwarded directly to the connected database system without a previous evaluation by %PRODUCTNAME.  
For example, if you access a database via ODBC interface, the SQL string will be passed to the ODBC driver and processed by it.  
Run SQL command directly  
Click the icon again to return to normal mode, in which the changes in the New Query Design are synchronized with the permitted changes via SQL.  
Functions  
If this icon has been pressed, you will see a line in the lower part of the Query Design called "Function".

General Shortcut Keys in %PRODUCTNAME  
This gives the default shortcut keys used throughout %PRODUCTNAME.  
Using Shortcut Keys  
A great deal of your application's functionality can be called up by using shortcut keys.  
For example, the Command+O Ctrl+O shortcut keys are shown next to the Open entry in the File menu.  
If you want to access this function by using the shortcut keys, press and hold down the key Command Ctrl and then press the O key.  
Release both keys after the dialog appears.  
When operating your application, you can choose between using the mouse or the keyboard for almost all of the operations available.  
Calling Menus With Shortcut Keys  
Some of the characters shown on the menu bar are underlined.  
You can access these menus directly by pressing the underlined character together with the ALT key.  
Once the menu is opened, you will again find underlined characters.  
You can access these menu items directly by simply pressing the underlined character key.  
Using Shortcut Keys to Control Dialogs  
There is always one element highlighted in any given dialog - usually shown by a broken frame.  
This element, which can be either a button, an option field, an entry in a list box or a check box, is said to have the focus on it.  
If the focal point is a button, pressing Enter runs it as if you had clicked it.  
A check box is toggled by pressing the spacebar.  
If an option field has the focus, use the arrow keys to change the activated option field in that area.  
Use the Tab key to go from one element or area to the next one, use Shift + Tab to go in the reverse direction.  
Pressing ESC closes the dialog without saving changes.  
If you place the focus on a button, not only will you see the dotted line framing the name of the button, but also a thicker shadow under the button selected.  
This indicates that if you exit the dialog by pressing the Enter key, it is the equivalent of pressing that button itself.  
Shortcut Keys for Mouse Actions  
If you are using drag and drop, selecting with the mouse or clicking objects and names, you can use the keys Shift, Command Ctrl and occasionally Option Alt to access additional functionality.  
The modified functions available when holding down keys during drag and drop are indicated by the mouse pointer changing form.  
When selecting files, objects, text passages and cells, rows and columns in tables, the modifier keys enhance, among other things, the selection - the functions are explained accordingly in the descriptions of the individual options.  
Practical Text Input Fields  
Convenient edit options are available in all text boxes and combo boxes, where you can enter text directly.  
You can open a context menu, which contains some of the most often-used commands.  
Use the shortcut keys Shift + Command Ctrl + S to open the Special Characters dialog to insert one or more special characters.  
Use Command Ctrl +A to select the entire text.  
Use the right or left arrow key to remove the selection.  
Double-click a word to select it.  
A triple-click selects the entire line.  
Use Command Ctrl +Del to delete everything from the cursor position to the end of the word.  
By using Command Ctrl and right or left arrow key, the cursor will jump from word to word; if you also hold down the Shift key, one word after the other is selected.  
INSRT is used to switch between the insert mode and the overwrite mode and back again.  
Drag&Drop cannot only be used within a text box but also from and to the "outside".  
The Command Ctrl + Z shortcut keys are used to undo modifications one step at a time; the text will then have the status it had before the first change.  
%PRODUCTNAME has a very useful AutoComplete function which activates itself in some text and combo boxes.  
For example, enter C:\ into the URL field and the AutoComplete function displays the first file or first directory found on the C: drive (or the equivalent for other operating systems).  
Use the down arrow key to scroll through the other files and directories.  
Use the right arrow key to also display an existing subdirectory in the URL field.  
Quick AutoComplete is available if you press the End key after entering part of the URL.  
Once you find the program, document or directory you want, press Enter.  
Interrupting Macros  
If you want to terminate a macro that is currently running, press SHIFT Command Ctrl + Q.

Creating a Homepage  
Here, you'll see how to create your homepage for the Internet and make it graphically interesting with the aid of various %PRODUCTNAME components.  
To conclude, your homepage will be put onto the Internet via your provider and registered with the search engines.  
You must follow some basic steps to make your homepage available to the Internet.  
Create the Web page(s) in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Create or search for the graphic objects you want to include on the page and save all graphics as files in a directory.  
It is best to use the directory where your HTML text files are also located or a subdirectory of thereof.  
You should also save graphics taken from the Gallery in an extra file.  
Insert the graphic elements as links in the %PRODUCTNAME text documents.  
Test how Web pages appear and work in the different Web browsers.  
Load the Web pages to your homepage space with your Internet Service Provider.  
So that you do not start with a blank page when creating Web pages, %PRODUCTNAME has interactive help for creating homepages that you can use as a good starting point for your own Web pages.  
Designing a Homepage Using %PRODUCTNAME  
It offers you interactive help; the individual steps are explained under File - AutoPilot.  
Give your HTML pages a title.  
This title will appear in the Title bar of Web browsers if your page is displayed, and will also be included as a bookmark.  
You can enter the title of your pages via File - Properties - Description in the Title field of this dialog.  
Save this HTML page as an HTML file in a directory where you store your Web pages.  
For example, you could store them in "C:\Homepage".  
In this directory, you can store all your Web pages and later upload them to your Internet Service Provider.  
Enter the name "Start.htm" or "Index.htm".  
Ask your provider if the first (Start) page of your homepage should have a specific name, so that your homepage is automatically loaded when browsing it without entering any page specification.  
Now check if the URL's have been stored on your pages in the file system with the relative path details.  
This is important so that the links to other elements of your homepage function in each directory and on each drive.  
To do this mark the in file system field in the area URLs relative save on the Tools - Options - Load/Save - General tab page.  
Directory Structure of the Homepage  
By using the AutoPilot, you can insert graphics problem-free into your Web page from your Internet service provider's (ISP) server.  
Create a folder on your hard disk for your homepage.  
Name it, for example, "homepage".  
This file is usually called "index.htm".  
Name the subdirectory, e.g., "graphics". (It is a good idea to enter all file and folder names in lowercase, since some servers differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters, i.e. case sensitive, in file and folder names.)  
Create a subdirectory called "graphics" in the space reserved for your homepage on the server of your Internet service provider.  
Only make references on your HTML pages to graphics that are stored in your "graphics" subdirectory in which you have integrated references of type <IMG SRC="graphics/picture1.gif">.  
This assumes that all graphics were inserted as links, and that you had already converted all graphics into GIF or JPG format.  
In fact, %PRODUCTNAME can automatically convert embedded graphics to GIF files and insert their corresponding tags into HTML pages, but you have no control over the file names.  
In this case, several graphics can be embedded, but several files will also be created.  
Test your homepage locally.  
If everything works, upload the HTML pages from "Homepage" to your homepage storage space with your ISP, and upload all graphics from the local "graphics" folder to the "graphics" folder on the server.  
Integrating Graphics in Homepages  
When working on your homepage, it makes sense, as long as you didn't start with a %PRODUCTNAME Writer/Web Document, to activate the Online Layout.  
You can then only choose commands that call up the page items allowed in HTML mode.  
The Online Layout command is found in the View menu.  
Graphics on the Internet must be in GIF or JPG (or PNG) format.  
Integrated graphics in other formats would be converted into JPG format by %PRODUCTNAME automatically when exported as HTML documents and are often given meaningless names.  
Thus, in order to have a well-structured and manageable homepage it is better to carry out the conversion to GIF or JPG yourself.  
Open %PRODUCTNAME and load graphics.  
Save the graphic using File-Save As in either GIF or JPG file format preferably in a subdirectory of C:\Homepage (see above).  
Close %PRODUCTNAME.  
Next, place the cursor on your homepage where you want to insert the graphic image.  
Select a JPG graphic using the Insert-Picture-From File command for the Homepage directory and select Link.  
The graphic image will be inserted once you press the Open button.  
Otherwise there could be certain unwanted effects ("jagged" effect when enlarging, thin lines disappearing when minimizing).  
Changing the Homepage Background  
Click in a free area of the page so that the picture is no longer selected.  
Call up Format-Page and select Background.  
In the list box As select Color.  
Select another background color and click OK.  
Try it the next time.  
You can then select whether you want the background graphic to be centered, anchored to a margin, or tiled.  
Uploading Homepage Files to Your ISP  
When you are satisfied with the way your homepage appears, you can upload all the files in your homepage directory to your Internet service provider.  
Ask your ISP about the exact procedure.  
Creating Simple Homepages  
If you want to quickly set up a homepage on the Internet with a few graphics, you don't even have to plan ahead:  
Open a new, empty page for your homepage (with File - New - HTML Document).  
Write and format the text, integrate any pictures (whether as a link or directly embedded, by either using the Insert - Graphics dialog or via Drag&Drop from the Gallery).  
Save the document locally.  
The graphic links will appear in the HTML source code, if you want to check it, but you do not have to be concerned about it.  
Open the Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML compatibility tab and ensure that the field Copy local graphics to Internet has been marked.  
You can create links to the Internet.  
Save the page using File - Save As.....  
Enter the full URL of your homepage at your ISP in the File Name field. e.g. http://homepages.provider.com/myname/index.htm.  
%PRODUCTNAME now automatically converts all linked and embedded graphics on the page into GIF format.  
The graphics are assigned new understandable names.  
Links to these graphics will be integrated into the HTML document as <IMG SRC="abc123.gif"> with the relative path.  
Then the HTML pages and all graphics will be uploaded to the specified directory.  
%PRODUCTNAME HTML Templates  
If you want to create a new page for the Internet, open a new HTML Document by choosing File - New.  
Another good tool for creating new pages for the World Wide Web is is the Online-Layout-Mode, which you can choose from the View menu.  
As soon as you have activated this mode you will see only those options in the menus and dialogs of %PRODUCTNAME which can be used on HTML pages.  
Creating a new page for the WWW  
First of all switch onthe Online-Layout-Mode by checking this entry in the View menu or by calling up a new HTML document. %PRODUCTNAME will then internally use the html.vor template which is located in {installpath}/share/template/english/internal  
You can enter text, insert objects, etc. into the new page as if it were a "normal" page.  
Use the special paragraph and character templtes that are provided by the HTML template.  
Furthermore when the HTML is exported %PRODUCTNAME will try to convert the document as closely to the original, depending on what the HTML format permits.  
To create an HTML page in your %PRODUCTNAME document, save the page in Web page format.  
Name the file, which ends with the .HTM or .HTML extension.  
HTML template (standard)  
If you use this page template, the pages will be without margins and almost any length so that your pages will not have page breaks.  
HTML Paragraph Styles  
The special Paragraph Styles for HTML pages have the following meaning:  
Paragraph Styles  
Definition  
BLOCKQUOTE  
You can format quotations as BLOCKQUOTES.  
If you do so, the text will be indented and in italics.  
DD 1-3, DT 1-3  
Glossaries can be structured using DT and DD formats.  
The first level will be titled DT1; the corresponding glossary text will be titled DD1.  
The first sublevel will be titled DT2 for the title and DD2 for the text.  
The third level will be formatted using DT3 and DD3.  
DT1 is left justified, DD1 is indented once, DT2 is indented like DD1, etc.  
DD is followed by a line break<p>, whereas DT is not.  
HR  
Insert a horizontal line the entire width of the page.  
PRE  
Text is formatted as preformatted text in the unproportional (TrueType) font, Courier.  
Since all spaces also appear in HTML text, this format is suitable for program listings with spaces and other similar types of texts.  
Character Styles for HTML Pages  
There are also specific font styles for HTML pages (of course, you can also use other styles), recognizable since they appear in capital letters.  
The following font styles are available:

Most of the formatting codes will be exported as HTML tags, but many Web browsers will display it in normal text.  
Converting Formatting to HTML  
%PRODUCTNAME is able to create the correct HTML code from your text document, for example.  
This means that listings in your documents will be exported as HTML tags which can then be displayed as either listings or lists in the Web browsers.  
Below you will find a selection of some of these formats:

%PRODUCTNAME 5.2 Database Import  
When you try to execute an AutoPilot and receive a message about "insufficient user rights", you have probably prohibited the execution of all basic macros under Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Security.  
To remedy this, change the setting from Never execute to Always execute or From List.  
AutoPilot Letter  
You can use this template for both, your business and your personal correspondence.  
%PRODUCTNAME comes with a sample template for a personal or business letter, which you can customize to your own needs with the help of the AutoPilot.  
The AutoPilot leads you step-by-step in creating a document template and offers numerous layout and design options.  
The preview gives you an impression of how the finished letter will appear according to the settings you choose.  
You may also skip an entire page or even all the AutoPilot pages, in which case the current (or default) settings will remain in effect.  
If you are creating a business letter, you can select a variety of elements to include in your document, which usually don't apply to personal letters, such as a subject line.  
Additionally, in a personal letter, the recipient only appears on the envelope, not on the first page of the letter.  
If you choose the Personal letter option, some pages which contain elements specific to business letters will not be included in the AutoPilot dialog.

As stated in document  
The slide transition depends on the timing that you set for each slide in the presentation.  
If you set a manual page transition, the HTML presentation introduces a new page by pressing any key from your keyboard.

Duration  
Define here the amount of time for each slide display.  
Endless  
Mark the Endless check box to automatically restart the HTML presentation after the last slide has been displayed.  
WebCast  
In a WebCast Export, automatic scripts will be generated with perl or ASP support.  
This enables the speaker (for example, a speaker in a telephone conference using a slide show in the Internet) to switch to other slides using the audience's web browser.  
You will find more information on WebCast further down in this chapter.  
Active Server Pages (ASP)  
When you select this option, the WebCast Export creates ASP pages.  
This HTML presentation however, can only be offered by a web server supporting ASP.  
Perl  
This option is used by WebCast to create HTML export pages and Perl scripts.  
URL for listeners  
Specify the URL (absolute or relative) to be entered by the viewer of the presentation in his or her Web Browser to view the presentation.  
URL for presentation  
Specify the URL (absolute or relative), where the created HTML presentation on the web server has been saved.  
URL for perl scripts  
Specify the URL for the generated perl scripts here.  
This URL can also be entered in an absolute or relative way.  
More Information on WebCast Export  
Active Server Pages (ASP) and Perl.  
In any case, the WebCast needs an HTTP Server offering Perl or ASP as scripting.  
Therefore, the exporting option basically depends on the used HTTP Server.  
Furthermore, you also need sound knowledge in working with the Web Server and ASP or Perl so that you can keep on working with the WebCast Export created files.  
WebCast in ASP  
Exporting  
To export in accordance with ASP in an open %PRODUCTNAME Impress document choose File - export.  
You then see the Export dialog in which you select Web page as the file type.  
Once you have selected a directory and entered a file name click Save.  
For export as ASP we recommend selecting a "secret" file name for the HTML file (see below for more details).  
You then see the Export HTML dialog.  
Several files are written to the directory you have just selected.  
The speaker will use the entered file name to change the slides of the presentation viewed by the audience.  
A normal directory or an HTTP URL on the HTTP Server can be selected as a directory.  
You can also transfer the created files on the HTTP Server, for example via FTP.  
Please note that WebCast can only work if the files are requested over an HTTP Server.  
For an HTML Export you will need to export the different directories in different directories.  
It is impossible to use two HTML Exports in the same directory since the second export would be partly overwritten.  
Select WebCast as a publishing type in the second page of the HTML Export AutoPilot.  
In the option area for WebCast, select the Active Server Pages (ASP) option.  
You can now continue defining other settings or start the Export by clicking the Create button.  
The Application  
You can use the WebCast Technology as soon as the exported files can be accessed over an HTTP Server.  
Example  
Let's assume that you installed the Microsoft Internet Information Server on your computer and you entered the "c:\Inet\wwwroot\presentation" directory as a root directory during the installation process.  
The URL of your computer should now read as follows: "http://myserver.com".  
You have saved the files that have been created during the Export process in the c:\Inet\wwwroot\presentation\ directory.  
In this directory, the Export creates an HTML file that can be named, for example, as "secret.htm".  
You entered this name in the Save dialog (see above).  
The speaker can now download the HTML Export by entering the http://myserver.com/presentation/secret.htm URL in any HTTP Browser having JavaScript support.  
The speaker is now able to modify the displayed slide using the displayed form fields.  
Any person from the audience can now view the slide that the speaker has selected via the URL http://myserver.com/presentation/webcast.asp.  
It is impossible to move to other slides from this URL.  
If the speaker does not inform the name of currently used URL, it is then impossible for the audience to obstruct the presentation.  
Note that the HTTP Server does not allow the display of the directories.  
WebCast over Perl  
Exporting  
To export, in an open %PRODUCTNAME Impress document choose File - Export.  
This opens the Export dialog, in which you select HTML as the file type.  
After selecting a folder and entering a file name, click Save.  
This opens the HTML Export Autopilot.  
This will write multiple files to the folder you have just selected.  
The entered file name will be used by the speaker to move through the slides.  
Please select an empty directory as your directory.  
In the second page of the AutoPilot HTML Export, select WebCast as the publication type.  
In the option area for WebCast, select Perl.  
Under the URL for listeners input field, enter the file name of the HTML document that will be used by the audience.  
Under URL for presentation, enter the URL of the directory that will be used for the presentation and, under URL for Perl scripts, enter the URL for the desired CGI script directory.  
You can now define further settings in the following pages of the AutoPilot or start the export process by clicking the Create button.  
The Application  
The files that have been created during the export process should now be included in the perl - capable HTTP Server.  
This cannot be done automatically because of the variety of different HTTP Servers having perl support.  
The steps to follow will be described in the following.  
Please refer to your server guide or ask your Network Administrator how to apply these steps on your server.  
You should first move the files that have been created during the export process into the correct directory on the HTTP Server.  
Move all files having the htm, jpg and gif extensions into the directory on your HTTP Server that has been referred to in the input field URL for presentation.  
All files having the pl and txt extensions have to be moved into the directory on your HTTP Server that has been referred to under the URL for scripts input field.  
This directory has to be configured in a way that the perl scripts contained there can also be run with an HTTP request.  
It is necessary under Unix systems to give the files with the pl extension the corresponding rights to be able to run in an HTTP Server.  
Normally, this is done via the chmod command.  
In the same way, the rights of the currpic.txt file should be set in such a way that the HTTP Server is able to write in this file.  
You should now be able to use WebCast.  
Example  
In this example, you have a Linux computer with an installed HTTP Server.  
The URL of your HTTP Server is http://myserver.com and the root directory of your HTML document is located in the //user/local/http / directory.  
Your perl scripts are contained in the //user/local/http/cgi-bin / directory.  
Enter secret.htm as a file name and presentation.htm as URL for the audience.  
Under the URL for presentation input field select http://myserver.com/presentation / and for the URL for perl scripts select http://myserver.com/cgi-bin /.  
Now, copy all *.htm, *.jpg and *.gif files from the directories that were specified during the export process into the "//user/local/http/presentation /" directory on your HTTP Server and copy all files with the *.pl and *.txt extensions into the "//user/local/http/cgi-bin /" directory.  
Login on your server as root and switch to the '//user/local/http/cgi-bin /' directory.  
You can define the corresponding rights using the chmod command.  
The audience can view this presentation under the URL "http://myserver.com/presentation/presentation.htm".

%PRODUCTNAME 5.2 Database Import  
This command starts an AutoPilot for importing %PRODUCTNAME 5.2 databases into %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION.  
Your links to databases created in %PRODUCTNAME 5.2, or database files such as address.dbf, are not modified, moved or deleted by this AutoPilot.  
The AutoPilot uses the information in the *.sdb file in %PRODUCTNAME 5.2 and registers a new data source in %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION.  
The data is thereafter accessible in %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION, e.g. under Tools - Data Sources or in the data source browser (F4).  
This AutoPilot does not create copies of the tables.  
For example, no copy is made of a dbf file in dBase format lying in your %PRODUCTNAME 5.2 directory.  
So do not delete the dbf file!  
If the selected *.sdb file contains queries or forms, these will, provided you specify this in the AutoPilot, be read from the *.sdb file and created as new documents in a directory of your choice.

Queries  
Queries are special views of tables, which can, for example, display certain records or only a few fields per record and if required also sort those records.  
A query can be for one table as well as for multiple tables, if they are linked by common data fields.  
Use queries to find records from data tables based on certain criteria.  
All queries created for a database are listed under the Queries entry.  
Since this entry contains the database queries, it is also called the "query container".  
Printing queries  
For printing a query or table do the following:  
Open a text document (or a spreadsheet document if you prefer the specific printing functions of this type of document).  
Open the database so that you can see the name of the query or table as an entry.  
Drag the name into the open document.  
You now see the dialog Insert Database Columns  
Decide which columns = data fields you want to include.  
You can also click the AutoFormat button and select a corresponding formatting.  
Close the dialog.  
The query or table will be inserted in your document.  
If you want, you can perform further modifications and print the document.  
You can also select the entire database table in the data source view (button in the top left corner of the table) and then drag this to a text document or spreadsheet.  
The %PRODUCTNAME Help provides you with further information about the following subjects:  
Creating a New Query  
In the context menu of a query container open the command New.  
Sorting and Filtering Data  
If you want to change the view of the data in a query table, you can use the sorting and filter functions.  
Query Design  
The query design window offers you all the possibilities to query tables.  
A SQL command will be interactiv generated which you can also reedit manually.  
Query via Several Tables  
The query result can contain data from several tables if these are linked to each other by suitable data fields.  
Formulating Query Criteria  
Here, you will find out which operators and commands can be used to formulate the filter conditions for a query.  
Executing Functions  
You can perform calculations with the data of a table and store the results as a query result.  
%PRODUCTNAME and SQL  
%PRODUCTNAME "understands" SQL.  
The syntax used depends on the database system you are using.  
Missing Element  
This dialog also offers you the possibility to decide how to continue with the procedure.  
How to continue?  
There are 3 options available for answering this question.  
Do you really want to open the query in the graphic view?  
This option allows you to open the query in the Design View in spite of missing elements.  
This option also allows you to specify if other errors have to be ignored.  
The query is opened in Design View (the graphical interface).  
Missing tables appear blank and invalid fields appear with their (invalid) names in the list of fields.  
For example, insert the renamed tables with their new names.  
Open the query in the SQL View  
Select this option to open the query design in the SQL Mode and to interpret the query as a Native SQL.  
Only when the %PRODUCTNAME statement is completely interpreted (only possible if the used tables or fields in the query really exist) you will be able to quit the native SQL mode.  
Do not open the query  
Select this option if you want to cancel the procedure and the query should not be opened.  
This option corresponds to the funtion of the Cancel dialog button.  
Also ignore similar errors  
If you selected the first option, but you still want to open the query in the graphics view, in spite of missing elements, you can define here if other errors should be ignored.  
Therefore, in the current opening process, no error message will be displayed, if the Query can not be correctly interpreted.  
Query Design  
In the design view of a query you have the possibility of creating a new query or editing an existing query.  
A number of databases also support the creation of a new table view.  
With the New view design context menu command in a table container of such a database you see the View window that resembles the Query window described here.  
The Design View  
To create a query, select the tables containing relevant data for the query.  
These tables will be displayed in the upper border of the query view.  
This enables you to define possible relationships between the tables in this area  
The lower area of the Design View serves for the actual query definition.  
To define the query, specify which field names will be accepted into the query and the criteria by which these fields should be displayed.  
In the top of the query design certain Symbols make various functions available to you.  
Thus, for example, you can execute a query that has been created in order to check it.  
BROWSE  
When you open the query design for the first time, in order to create a new query, you can click Add Tables.  
You then see a dialog in which you must first select the tables on the basis of which you want to create a query.  
In the tables window the data fields of the selected tables are listed.  
While designing a query you will not be able to modify the selected tables.  
This guarantees that the tables cannot be modified when a query is created.  
Even if you select a table and then remove it, this table will be still be locked for the table design  
Remove tables  
To remove the table from Design View, click the upper border of the table window and display the context menu.  
Another option is to press the (Del) key.  
Move table and modify table size  
You can resize and arrange the tables according to your preferences.  
To move tables, drag the upper border to the desired position.  
Enlarge or reduce the size in which the table is displayed by positioning the mouse cursor on a border or on a corner and dragging the table until it is the desired size.  
Table Relations  
If there are data relations between a field name in one table and a field name in another table, you can use these relations for your query.  
If, for example, you have a spreadsheet for articles in which each article is clearly identified by an article number, and a spreadsheet for customers in which you record all articles that a customer orders, using the appropriate article numbers, then there is a relationship between the two "article number" data fields.  
If you now want to create a query, that returns all articles that a customer has ordered, you must retrieve data from two spreadsheets.  
To do this, you must tell %PRODUCTNAME what the relationship is between the data in the two spreadsheets.  
To do this, click a field name in a table (for example, the field name "Item-Number" from the Customer table), hold down the mouse button and then drag the field name to the field name of the other table ("Item-Number" from the Item table).  
When you release the mouse button you will see a line connecting the two fields in the two windows.  
The corresponding condition that the content of the two field names must be identical is entered in the resulting SQL query.  
The creation of a query that is based in several sheets that relate to each other, is only possible if you use %PRODUCTNAME as the interface for a relational database such as Adabas.  
You cannot access tables from different databases in a query.  
Queries involving multiple tables can only be created within a database.  
Specifying link type  
If you double-click a line connecting the two linked fields, you can specify the type of link in the Joint Properties dialog.  
Deleting relations  
To delete a relation between two tables, click the connection line and then press the (Del) key.  
Define query  
The query is defined in the lower area of the design view.  
Each column of the design table accepts a data field for the query.  
You can define the conditions for each data field in the table rows.  
The query will be created according to those conditions.  
The conditions in one row are linked with a Boolean AND.  
Specify field name  
First select all field names from the tables that you want to add to the query.  
You can do this either with Drag&Drop or by double-clicking a field name in the table window.  
With the Drag&Drop method, you use the mouse to drag a field name of a table window into the lower area of the query design.  
As you do this you can decide which column you want to add the field in question to.  
Select a field name by double-clicking.  
It will then be added to the next free column.  
Deleting field names  
To remove a field name from the query, click the column header of the field and choose the Delete command on the context menu for the column.  
Save query  
Use the Save icon on the function bar to save the query.  
You see a dialog that asks you to enter a name for the query.  
If the database supports schemas, you can also enter a schema.  
Schema  
Enter the name of the schema that is assigned to the query/table view.  
Query / table view name.  
Enter the name of the query / table view.  
Filtering data  
To filter data for the query, set the desired preferences in the lower area of the Design View.  
The following lines are available for you here:  
Field  
Enter here the name of the data field to which you referred in the Query.  
All settings made in the lower rows, refer to this field.  
If you activate a cell with a mouse click you'll see an arrow button, which enables you to select a field.  
The "Table name.*" option selects all data fields and the criteria is valid for all table fields.  
Alias  
You can enter here an alias.  
This alias will be listed in a query instead of the field name.  
By this means, it is possible to use user defined column labels.  
For example, if the data field in the table has the "ArticleNr" label and instead of that name, you would like to have the name "Article-Number" to appear in the query, enter "Article-Number" as alias (without the quotation marks).  
In an SQL statement alias are defined as following:  
SELECT column AS alias FROM table.  
Thus, for example  
SELECT "ItemNo" AS Item-Number FROM "Item"  
Table  
The respective database table of the selected data field is listed here.  
If you activate the a cell with a mouse click, an arrow will appear which enables you to select another table of the current query.  
Sort  
If you click the cell, you can select among the sorting options: ascending, descending and not sorted.  
Text fields will be sorted alphabetically (A to Z) and numerical fields numerically (0 to 9).  
Visible  
If you mark the Visible property for a data field, that field will be visible in the query.  
If you only use a data field to formulate a condition, you do not necessarily need to show it.  
Criteria  
Enter here a criteria after which the content of the data field should be filtered.  
or  
Here you can enter one additional criterion for filtering in each line.  
Multiple criteria in one column will be connected by an OR link.  
You can also use the context menu of the line headers in the lower area of the query design to insert another line for functions:  
Functions  
Select a function to run in the query here.  
You have various possibilities to run functions in queries.  
These possibilities depend on the used database system.  
If you are working with databases in Adabas format, the list box in the Function row offers you the following options (activate the visibility of the Function row via the context menu):  
Option  
SQL  
Effect  
No function  
-  
No function will be executed.  
Average  
AVG  
Calculates the arithmetic mean of a field.  
Count  
COUNT  
Determines the number of records in the table.  
Empty fields can either be counted as well (a) or not (b).  
a) COUNT(*):  
Passing an asterisk as the argument counts all records in the table.  
b) COUNT(column):  
Passing a field name as an argument counts only fields in which the field name in question contains a value.  
Null values (empty fields) will not be counted.  
Maximum  
MAX  
Determines the highest value of a field.  
Minimum  
MIN  
Determines the lowest value of a field.  
Sum  
SUM  
Calculates the sum of values of associated fields.  
Group  
GROUP BY  
Groups query data according to the field name selected.  
Functions are executed according to the specified groups.  
In SQL this option corresponds to the GROUP BY clause.  
If a criterion is added, this entry appears in the SQL HAVING.  
You can also enter function calls directly in the SQL statement.  
The syntax is:  
SELECT FUNCTION(column) FROM table.  
For example, the function call in SQL for calculating a sum is:  
SELECT SUM("Price ") FROM" Article ".  
Except for the Group function, the above functions are so-called Aggregate functions.  
These are functions that calculate data to create summaries of the results.  
Additonal functions that are not listed in the list box are also possible.  
These depend on the specific database system in use.  
To get information about driver specific functions refer to the documentation of your database system.  
To use other functions not listed in the list box, you must enter them under Field.  
They will then appear automatically in the Function line.  
You can also assign aliases to function calls.  
If the query is not to be displayed in the column header, enter the desired name under Alias.  
The corresponding function in an SQL statement is:  
SELECT FUNCTION() AS alias FROM table  
Example:  
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM "Item"  
If you run this function, you cannot insert any additional columns for the query other than receiving these columns as a "Group" function.  
Examples  
In the following example, a query is run through two tables: an "Item" table with the "Item_No" field and a "Suppliers" table with the "Supplier_Name" field.  
In addition, both tables have a common field name "Supplier_No."  
The following steps are required to create a query containing all suppliers who deliver more than three items.  
Insert the "Item" and "Suppliers" tables into the query design.  
Link the "Supplier_No" fields of the two tables if there is not already a relation of this type.  
Double-click the "Item_No" field from the "Item" table.  
Display the Function line using the context menu and select the Count function.  
Enter >3 as a criterion and disable the Visible field.  
Double-click the "Supplier_Name" field in the "Suppliers" table and choose the Group function.  
Run the query.  
Done!  
If the "price" (for the individual price of an article) and "Supplier_No" (for the supplier of the article) fields exist in the "Item" table, you can obtain the average price of the item that a supplier provides with the following query:  
Insert the "Item" table into the query design.  
Double-click the "Price" and "Supplier_No" fields.  
Enable the Function line and select the Average function from the "Price" field.  
You can also enter "Average" in the line for the alias name (without quotation marks).  
Choose Group for the "Supplier_No" field.  
Run the query.  
Done!  
The following context menu commands and symbols are available:  
Functions  
Shows/hides a bar for functions.  
Table Name  
Shows or hides the row for the table name.  
Alias Name  
Shows or hides the row for the alias name.  
Distinct Values  
Activate this command to apply only distinct values to the query.  
This concerns records containing data which appears several times in the selected fields.  
If the Distinct Values command is active, you will see only one record in the query (DISTINCT).  
Otherwise, you will see all records corresponding to the query criteria (ALL).  
For example, to record all the last names in your address database in a query but the name "Smith" occurs several times, you can choose the Unique Values command to specify in the query that the name "Smith" will occur only once.  
For a query involving several fields, the combination of values from all fields must be unique so that the result can be formed from a specific record.  
For example, let's say you have "Smith in Chicago" once in your address book and "Smith in London" twice.  
With the Unique Values command, the query will use the two fields "last name" and "city" and return the query result "Smith in Chicago" once and "Smith in London" once.  
In SQL this command corresponds to the DISTINCT predicate.  
Formulating filter conditions  
When formulating filter conditions various operators and commands are available to you.  
Apart from the relational operators there are SQL-specific commands that query the content of database fields.  
If you use these commands in the %PRODUCTNAME syntax, %PRODUCTNAME automatically converts these into the corresponding SQL syntax.  
You can also enter the SQL command directly.  
The following tables give an overview of the operators and commands:  
Operator  
Condition is satisfied if...  
=  
equal to  
... the content of the field is identical to the indicated expression.  
The operator = will not be displayed in the query fields.  
If you enter a value without any operator, the operator = will be automatically adopted.  
Join Properties  
If you double click a series line between two linked fields in the query design, you can determine the link type in the Join Properties dialog.  
This setting will be then used in all queries created in the future.  
Options  
Specify the link type of the selected link.  
Queries about the various types of links differ in the number of records displayed.  
Four options are available:  
For the internal join the results table contains only the records for which the content of the linked fields is the same.  
In %PRODUCTNAME SQL this type of link is created by a corresponding WHERE clause.  
For the left join the results table contains all fields of the left table and only those fields of the right table for which the content of the linked fields is the same.  
In %PRODUCTNAME SQL this type of link corresponds to the LEFT OUTER JOIN command.  
For the right join the results table contains all fields of the right table and only those fields of the left table for which the content of the linked fields is the same.  
In %PRODUCTNAME SQL this type of link corresponds to the RIGHT OUTER JOIN command.  
For a full join the results table contains all fields of the left and right tables.  
In the SQL of %PRODUCTNAME this type of link corresponds to the FULL OUTER JOIN command.  
Display Field  
Shows the help of the current selected option.  
Forms  
They can be used to enter or to edit existing data easily.  
Unlike in the data view of a table, forms only ever show one record at a time on the screen and also only the fields that you need for the form.  
All forms that are created by %PRODUCTNAME in a database are listed under the Forms database entry.  
Since this entry also incorporates the database forms, it is also known as "Form container".  
Forms that you create using commands in the Forms floating toolbar in a %PRODUCTNAME document, can be saved to any location just like any other document.  
These forms do not appear in the form container of %PRODUCTNAME, they are handled like documents of the respective type.  
In the %PRODUCTNAME Help, you will find further information on the following subjects:  
Creating New Forms  
In order to create a new form, call the command New in the context menu of a form container.  
AutoPilot  
Here, you will find a detailed description of the pages you run through when creating a form with the AutoPilot.  
Form Functions  
The form functions offer the tools required to create a form in a text, table, drawing, or presentation document.  
Form in Design Mode  
In Design mode, the form is designed and, in particular, the properties of the form and the controls contained in it are defined.  
Sorting and Filtering Data  
You will find the sorting and filter functions in the form bar when you open a form in User mode.  
Subforms  
Form Context Menus  
The context menu of the form container offers various functions, which you can generally correlate to all database forms.  
To edit a special form within a database, select the corresponding form and open its context menu.  
You will find the following commands on the context menus:  
New  
The Form View opens when a form is selected.  
You will also find the following commands on the context menus of individual forms:  
Form Design  
This command opens the form in the design mode.  
This command is not available in read-only databases.  
Forms are physically deleted.  
New Form  
In the data source explorer for a "links" entry, select the New form menu item if you want to create a new form.  
A submenu opens from which you can choose if you want to create the form with the help of an AutoPilot or if it is to be created in a text, spreadsheet or presentation document.  
If you select Text document, Spreadsheet or Presentation, you must create the form manually.  
The form functions enable you to design a form in the desired document.  
This dialog enables you to select a template, which you can use as a starting point to create the form.  
Insert the desired form functions and save the new form.  
Selecting the AutoPilot command displays a wizard that will lead you through the steps of the remaining procedure for creating a new form.  
Save Form  
Enter the name for the object to be saved.  
If the form is created in a text, table or presentation document, the first time you save it, you'll see the Save as dialog where you have to enter a name for the form to be saved.  
After you click OK, the corresponding entry will appear for the new form in the form container of the database.  
If you use the AutoPilot to create a new form, the form is saved as soon as you click the Create button on the last page of the assistant.  
The form then likewise appears under its name in the "links" container of the data source.  
Form Design  
Any %PRODUCTNAME document can be expanded into a form.  
Simply add one or more form functions.  
The Form icon of the main toolbar opens a floating toolbar by long clicking the icon.  
This floating toolbar contains the basic functions to edit a form.  
You will find again many of these functions in the object bar if you select a form element in the document.  
If you click a form element in the editing mode, Object bar, Format menu commands and context menus offer context-sensitive editing functions.  
In the form design you can Include controls, Apply properties to them, define Form properties and Define subforms.  
Here the Form Navigator that you open on the object bar or the floating toolbar is a useful tool.  
With the command Open in Design Mode you can save a form document so that it always opens in editing mode.  
If you receive an error when assigning the properties for the objects contained in the form (for example, when assigning a non-existent database table to an object), you'll see a corresponding error message.  
This error message can have an More button.  
If you click More, you'll see then a dialog displaying clear information, warnings and errors about the current problem.  
Tables  
In the tables of the data sources you see your data line by line.  
You can make new entries and deletions.  
In the %PRODUCTNAME Help, you will find further information on the following subjects:  
Create new or edit table design  
Sort and Filter Data  
Relations, Primary and External Key  
Table Context Menus  
The context menu of the table container offers various functions, which can be generally correlated to all database tables.  
To edit a special table within the database, select the corresponding table and open its context menu.  
Depending on the context it is possible that for your current database not all the functions listed here appear.  
Thus, for example, the Relationships command for definition of relationships between various tables is only available with relational databases.  
Depending on the database system used, you will find the following entries on the context menus  
If a table is open you have several functions available to edit the data.

Index details  
As soon as you change a detail of the current index and then select another index, this change is immediately passed to the data source.  
So you can only leave the dialog or select another index, if the change has been successfully acknowledged by the data source.  
You can, however, undo the change by clicking Reset current index.  
Unique  
Check this box if the index is to be unique.  
Then no two records in this data field should have the same content.

Select the sort order.  
Close  
Close the dialog here.  
You are asked if you want to save the changes or not.  
Relations  
This command opens a window for definition of relationships between various database tables.  
Click the New relationship icon to create the relationships, or simply drag and drop with the mouse.  
This function is only available for database relationships, i.e. you only see the command if you use %PRODUCTNAME as the front-end for a relational database.  
If you start the Relation design command in the context menu of the table container, a window opens in which all the existing relationships between the tables of the current database are shown.  
If no relationships have yet been defined, or if you want to relate other tables of the database to each other, then click the Add tables icon.  
A Dialog opens in which you can select the tables that you want.  
If the relation window is open, the selected tables cannot be modified, even in table Design Mode.  
This ensures that it will not be possible to modify the tables while the relations are being created.  
The selected tables are shown in the top area of the design view.  
You can remove a table window again via the context menu with the (Remove) key.  
Primary key and other key  
If you want to define a relation among the different tables, you should at least enter a primary key that clearly identifies a data field of the existing table.  
You can refer to the primary key from other table to access the data of this table.  
All data fields referring to this primary key will be identified as an external key.  
All data fields referring to a primary key will be identified in the table window by a small key symbol.  
Consider the "Item" table, for example, where each individual record can be defined by an item number.  
The "Item-Number" field is thus a unique key in this table, and is referred to as a "primary key".  
There is an additional table with the name "Orders" in the database.  
The number of the ordered item is assigned to each record in this table through an "Item-Number" field.  
This field is also a key field.  
It contains a key used to access the records of another table, in this case the "Item" table.  
For this reason, this field is referred to as the "foreign key".  
A relation is used to relate the primary key of the "Article" sheet and the other key of the "Orders" sheet.  
Define relations  
All existing relations are shown in the relations windows by a line that connects the primary and other key fields.  
You can add a relation by using drag and drop to drop the field of one table onto the field of the other table.  
A relation is removed again by pressing the (Remove) key (for which purpose it must be the current selection).  
Alternatively you can also click the New relation icon in the top area of the relation field and define the relation between two tables in a Dialog.  
If you use %PRODUCTNAME as the front-end for a relational database, the creation and deletion of relationships is not placed in an intermediate memory by %PRODUCTNAME but is forwarded directly to the external database.  
By double-clicking a connection line you can assign certain properties to the relation.  
The Relations dialog opens.  
Relations  
This is where you define a relation between two tables.  
These update and delete options are only available if they are supported by the database used.  
Tables  
This is where the two related tables are listed.  
If you create a new relation, you can select one table from each of the combo boxes in the top part of the dialog.  
If you displayed the Relations dialog for an existing relation by double-clicking the connection lines in the Relation window, then the tables involved in the relation cannot be modified here.  
Key fields  
This is where you define key fields for the relation.  
The names of the tables selected for the link appear here as column names.  
If you click a field, then you can use the arrow buttons to select a field of the table.  
Each relation is written in a row.  
Update options  
Here you can set preferences that will take effect for changes to a primary key field.  
No Action  
If you select this option, any change made to a primary key does not affect other external key fields.  
Updating cascade  
Select this option to update all the external key fields if the value of the corresponding primary key has been modified (Cascading Update).  
Set Null  
If the corresponding primary key has been modified, use this option to set the "IS NULL" value to all external key fields.  
IS NULL means that the field is empty.  
Set Default  
If the corresponding primary key has been modified, use this option to set a default value to all external key fields.  
During the creation of the corresponding table, the default value of an external key field will be defined when you assign the field properties.  
Delete options  
Here you can selection options that will take effect when a primary key field is deleted.  
No Action  
With this option, the deletion of a primary key will not have any effect on other external key fields.  
Delete cascade  
With this option, all external key fields will be deleted if you delete the corresponding primary key field.  
Note that when you delete a primary key field with this option, all records of other tables that have this key as their foreign key are also deleted.  
Use this option with great care; in the worst case scenario, a major portion of the database could be deleted!  
Set Null  
With this option, if you delete the corresponding primary key, the "IS NULL" value will be assigned to all external key fields.  
Set Default  
With this option, if you delete the corresponding primary key, a set value will be set to all external key fields.  
Copy query or table by drag and drop.  
In this dialog you can define the options for copying a query or a table.  
You can use drag and drop to copy a query from %PRODUCTNAME, but you can just as easily do the same with a table from a %PRODUCTNAME Writer or HTML document or a marked part of this, or a cell range from a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet.  
To modify the query, use drag and drop.  
You can:  
create a query copy,  
take over the data from the query into another query,  
use the structure of the table as the basis for creating a new table.  
It makes no difference for these actions whether the exchange is to take place within the same database or between different databases.  
Select the query and drag it into the table container of the desired database.  
Copying Tables  
If in the data source view you copy a query or table by dragging and dropping to a table container, you see the Copy table AutoPilot.  
Table Name  
This copy will be saved in the target destination.  
Some database formats only accept names containing 8 characters.  
Options  
Definition and Data  
Select this option to create a 1:1 copy of the database table.  
The table definition and the complete data will be copied.  
The table definition includes the table structure and format from different data fields (including special field properties).  
The field contents supply the data.  
Definition  
This option copies only the table definition and not the corresponding data.  
As Table View  
If the database supports Views, you can select this option only when a query is copied in a table container.  
You have the possibility with this option to see and edit a query in a normal table view.  
The table will be filtered in the view with a "Select" SQL statement.  
Append data  
Check this box to insert the data of the table to be copied into an existing table having the same name.  
Data cannot be copied if no data field having the same name is found or if the field in the target table has another format as the source table.  
Perform the assignment of the data field names in the Copy Table AutoPilot on the Assign columns page.  
If the data could not be annexed or was only partially annexed, you will see in the Column Info dialog a list of fields whose data cannot be copied.  
If you confirm this dialog with OK, only the data, which fulfills the criteria for copying will be annexed.  
If the fields of the target table have a smaller field length as in the source table when data is being annexed, adjust the field contents of the copied table to the length of the fields in the target table.  
Creating Primary Keys  
If you check this box, a primary key field is automatically generated and filled with values.  
You should use this field if, for example, you copy a dBase table to the Adabas format, since in the Adabas format a primary key must always be available in order to edit the table.  
Name:  
Here you have the option of giving a name to the primary key generated.  
On page 2 of the AutoPilot

Automatic type recognition  
You can see this area if, for example, you drag a table from a document using drag and drop to a table container.  
The data field types can often be recognized automatically from the contents.  
(max.) lines  
Enter here how many lines should be used in order to cause an automatic type recognition.  
Auto  
Use this button to start the automatic type recognition.  
Assign columns  
On this page you define what content of the data fields of a source table should be copied to which other data fields in the destination table.  
You see the dialog as the second page of the Copy table AutoPilot for dragging and dropping tables, if on the first page you have selected the Attach data option.  
If you want to move the entries to the left or right page, use the up and down buttons until the corresponding data field names of both lists are next to each other.  
This dialog relates solely to assignment when copying.  
Source table  
Here you see all available data fields in the source table, from which the data to be attached comes.  
You can mark the data fields, whose content is to be copied, in the boxes in front of the data field names.  
With the all and none buttons you can mark all data field names at the same time or remove all marks at the same time.  
Destination table  
Here you see all data fields in the destination table in which the new data is to be inserted.  
up  
The entry marked on this page of the dialog, along with its marking, is moved one position upwards.  
On the other page of the dialog only the mark is moved, not the marked entry.  
down  
The entry marked on this page of the dialog, along with its marking, is moved one position downwards.  
On the other page of the dialog only the mark is moved, not the marked entry.  
all  
All entries of the source table receive a mark.  
All contents of the marked data fields are attached to the destination table.  
none  
All marks in the source table are removed.  
General  
The Properties dialog of a database table is used, amongst other things, in order to define the rights that the current user has for the table.  
General  
When you, as administrator, create a database table, you can use this register to determine if and to what extent the user has access to this table and can manipulate the data or table structure.  
You can access this tab page by opening the context menu of a table and selecting Properties.  
As the current user, you can check the General tab from the Properties dialog to view your access rights for the table.  
For example, if you are not allowed to delete data in a table, information on this subject will be shown on the General tab.  
This tab, however, cannot be used to modify the different settings.  
Table name  
Enter here the name of the dabase table.  
Type  
The object's type will be listed here, that is, the tables in the case of database tables.  
Location  
The complete path of the database table will be shown here.  
Read data  
Check this field to enable the user to read the data.  
Insert data  
Check this field to enable the user to insert new data.  
Change data  
Check this field to enable the user to change the data.  
Delete data  
Check this field to enable the user to delete data.  
Change table structure  
Check this field to enable the user to manually change the table structure.  
Definition  
Check this field to enable the user to delete the table structure.  
Modify references  
Check this field to enable the user to modify the defined references.  
That means that the user will be able to enter new relations for this table or delete already existing ones.  
Description  
This is where you can see the description entered for this table.  
Table description  
In this field you can see the description for the current table.  
Databases  
Register databases that you want to use in %PRODUCTNAME by choosing Tools - Data sources.  
Data sources in %PRODUCTNAME  
Data sources - Properties  
Copy or Move Database Objects with Drag&Drop  
Entering SQL Administration Commands  
Database Systems Supported  
Please also note further information on %PRODUCTNAME data sources  
Data sources in %PRODUCTNAME  
This is where you find information about data sources in %PRODUCTNAME.  
The following are also explained on this page:  
The Address Book  
Create data source  
Open data source  
Moving or Copying Database Objects with Drag&Drop  
The Address Book  
In a dialog you can define which data field from your system address book is assigned to which placeholder.  
This dialog can be started by choosing File - Template - Address Book Source; apart from this, it starts automatically when you access one of our templates for the first time and this assignment has not yet taken place.  
Create a new data source  
In a dialog, from Tools - Data Sources, you can specify the data source, give it a name by which it is addressed in %PRODUCTNAME and, depending on the type selected, specify various options.  
When setting up an existing database in %PRODUCTNAME, simply indicate the data source.  
If you will be using a text or dBase database then this will be a folder containing the database together with its tables.  
All of the tables (database files) together in one folder (directory) form a database.  
Registering a data source in %PRODUCTNAME is in essence no different from creating a link to the database.  
This link allows you access to the data.  
To open a data source  
The data source view is shown/hidden by pressing the (F4) key with a text, spreadsheet or form document open.  
If you open a data source by clicking the + in front of its name, you see the entries for links, queries and tables.  
Copying and Moving Database Objects using Drag and Drop  
You can exchange database contents within %PRODUCTNAME using Drag&Drop.  
You can easily create copies of a database object within a database this way as well.  
For example, to create a new query that differs only slightly from an existing query, simply copy this query and then make the changes in Query Design.  
It is also possible for you to drop a table or selected parts of tables from a %PRODUCTNAME Writer document, an HTML document or from %PRODUCTNAME Calc into a table container using drag and drop.  
You can just as easily drag, for example, a table from the data source view into a text document.  
Database objects can also be copied and moved.  
When they are copied, the original stays where it is; when they are moved, it is deleted.  
To copy an object, simply drag it to the desired location with the mouse.  
To move it, hold down the shift key while dragging.  
To copy or move database objects, select them one after the other, and then drag the selection to the target destination with the mouse.  
When converting between various database types, it should be noted that the field definitions follow different conventions.  
Field or column names in dBase tables should, for example, only be 10 characters long, but for Adabas tables they can be 18 characters long.  
If you copy or move a table with Drag&Drop and the field length in the destination table is smaller than in the source table, a dialog will ask you to rename the field.  
You can also use the Auto button in the dialog to have %PRODUCTNAME adapt the names automatically.  
Copy or move query  
When you use Drag&Drop for a query, the query is copied when you let it drop over a query container.  
Holding down the Shift key as you drag will move the query.  
If there is already a query of the same name, the New Name dialog box appears in which you must enter a new name for the copy.  
If you drag the query onto a table container instead of a query container, the query will be treated as a table.  
If you use Drag&Drop to copy or move multiple queries at the same time, the program prompts you about the copy procedure for each query.  
New Name  
Enter a new name here under which the copy will be saved.  
If you want to copy or move a database object and another object already exists with the same name, you can enter a new name in the New Name dialog.  
If you cancel this dialog, the copying process will not start.  
General  
Select the name, type and data source of the database here.  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you have various possibilities for working with a database.  
You can:  
Incorporate databases in the dBase or Text format in %PRODUCTNAME,  
Access an existing database via ODBC or JDBC.,  
access an ADO database.  
The data source can be a directory in which dBase or text files are stored, or a data source for an existing database that you want to access.  
The entry depends on the database type you want to use in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Adabas D format  
In Windows and Unix the Adabas D format can be used.  
dBase or Text format  
If you want to include files in dBase or text format, simply indicate the corresponding directory of the files.  
Every file is listed on the Tables tab as a database table so that it can be integrated into %PRODUCTNAME as a database table.  
Accessing external databases  
Even when accessing a database system that offers an SQL interface, you need to enter a data source.  
The data source is specified by its label rather than a special directory.  
They are available immediately for use in %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can access an external SQL database via ODBC.  
If you installed the appropriate ODBC driver, you can access almost any external database that recognizes ODBC.  
You can integrate an ODBC database only if your computer has a 32-bit operating system and a 32-bit ODBC driver installed.  
Name  
This is where you enter the name you use to call the database in %PRODUCTNAME.  
This name is only used to call the database within %PRODUCTNAME - absolutely no files in the database will be renamed.  
Connection  
Database type  
This is where the type of database is defined.  
If you want to register a database, then in the combo box select the corresponding type of database from the database types offered.  
You can select between Adabas, dBase, Text, ODBC, JDBC, ADO, and spreadsheet.  
Data Source URL  
This is where you enter the data source URL you want to access.  
A protocol schema will automatically be put in front of it, e.g. "sdbc:", "sdbc:dbase:", or "jdbc:".  
For databases in Adabas format, the name of the Adabas files is entered here.  
If you access a remote Adabas database, enter the data source as "Computer name:Database name" (without quotation marks).  
For databases in dBase or text format, the directory that contains the dBase or text files forms the data source.  
In this case, the complete path to the respective directory is entered.  
If you want to access an external database via ODBC, the data source will be listed here.  
...  
Clicking this button opens a dialog where you can select a data source.  
For databases of the dBase or text type you reach the Select Path dialog, by selecting the directory that contains your database.  
When ODBC or the address book driver is accessed the Data Source dialog opens.  
New database  
This opens the Create New Adabas Database dialog.  
Data Source  
Choose the data source you want to access in %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you want to register an external database in %PRODUCTNAME, you first have to indicate the data source to the program.  
The data source covers both the data, which you want to access, as well as the information that enables the data to be accessed.  
Accessing a database via ODBC requires the corresponding driver for this database.  
If it is installed, you can define multiple data sources for each installed driver.  
The data sources defined for all drivers installed on your system are listed in this dialog.  
Data Sources  
All data sources that you can access are listed here.  
Apart from the designation of the data source the associated drivers are listed in each case.  
Select the data source that you want to register in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Organizer  
This button opens an operating system-specific dialog for administration of your data sources.  
Here you can add, delete or configure data sources.  
You can find a description of this in your operating system Help.  
ODBC  
This is where you can define specific settings for a database which is accessed by means of ODBC.  
This includes your personal access data, perhaps driver settings and font definitions.  
An ODBC database normally resides on one of the larger computer on the network.  
Access is limited to authorized users.  
A table must have a clear index, if you want to edit or add records in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Note that the ODBC drivers are always supplied and supported by the database manufacturer; the ODBC drivers are not a component of %PRODUCTNAME. %PRODUCTNAME supports only the ODBC 3 standard.  
User Name  
Enter your user name into this field so that you can access the database.  
Password required  
Mark this check box if a password is necessary to access the database.  
You will always be asked to enter the password when you first connect to the database during a session.  
Driver Settings  
Use this text field to enter additional optional driver settings if this is necessary.  
Character Set  
This is where you select the code conversion to be used for viewing the database in %PRODUCTNAME (the data itself does not change).  
Databases running in DOS as a rule use the ASCII character set, which is compiled from various code pages (country-specific character sets) under "IBMPC (850) / DOS".  
In windows the ANSI character set is used, and Macintosh uses the character set referred to here as "MAC".  
Enter "System" to select the character set that represents the default for the operating system in which you have started %PRODUCTNAME.  
Use Catalog for file-based databases.  
If you check this box, the current data source of the Catalog is used.  
This may be necessary if, for example, the ODBC data source is a database server.  
Problems can, however arise when Catalog is used, if the ODBC data source is, for example, a dBase driver in which case the box should not be checked.  
dBase  
Make special settings for a dBase database here.  
dBase here means the database and file format that is used by the database applications originally introduced by Ashton Tate and later by Borland.  
The format represents an industry standard.  
If any other notation is used the tables are not recognized.  
Display inactive records  
Check this box to show all records of the file, even those that have been marked as deleted (inactive).  
Indexes  
In the Indexes dialog, you can organize the dBase tables indexes in the current database.  
Indexes  
This is where you organize dBase database indexes.  
This enables you to have quicker access to a database, as long as you queried the data in the selection that was defined through the indexes.  
When you design a table, define the indexes on the Indexes tab page.  
Table  
Select the desired database table from this list box.  
Table Indexes  
To remove one or all indexes, click on the right arrow button.  
Free Indexes  
In this field, you will find a list of the available indexes not yet assigned to a table.  
To assign an index to a selected table, click the left arrow icon.  
The left double arrow assigns all available indexes.  
<  
Click this icon to move the selected index to the Table Indexes field.  
<<  
Click here to move all free indexes to the Table Indexes field.  
>  
It will be moved to the Free Indexes field.  
>>  
These will be moved the Free Indexes field.  
Text  
Here you can define special settings for importing a database in text format.  
In text format databases, data is stored as unformatted ASCII files.  
In text format, every data record has its own row.  
The data fields are divided by separators, and text in the data fields is usually in quotation marks.  
The text format lets you import the contents of the database into other applications and other platforms.  
There is almost always a text export filter.  
You can use %PRODUCTNAME Calc to edit ASCII files or text format databases.  
Text contains header  
Mark this box if the first line of the file contains the field names.  
These are then interpreted as column headers for the database table.  
Field separator  
Enter here the separator used in the file.  
You can choose among a semicolon (;), comma (,), colon (:), tab, space, or another character, which you can enter in the respective combo box.  
Text separator  
Enter here the character to identify a text field in the database.  
This must be different from the field separator.  
If, for example, you define a quotation mark as a text separator, it cannot be defined as a field separator as well.  
Decimal separator  
Enter here the normally used separator for decimal numbers.  
The most common separators are a period (0.5) or a comma (0,5), depending on regional settings.  
Thousands separator  
Enter here the separator for thousands The most common separators, are a period (1.000) or a comma (1,000), depending on regional settings.  
Extension  
Use this Combo box to select an extension for the text files.  
The extension selected also partly defines the default settings in the other combo boxes.  
The *.csv extension means that the character set is set to system and the field delimiter to comma (,).  
The *.txt or *.sdf extension causes the field delimiter to be set to semicolon (;), and for *.sdf the character set is in addition changed to "IBMPC (850) / DOS".  
Edit a database table in text format  
However, you can import the table into %PRODUCTNAME Calc, edit it there and then save it as a text format database table with a new name.  
Create a new %PRODUCTNAME Calc table document.  
Open the data source view, e.g. by pressing the (F4) key.  
Display the table you want in the data source view.  
In the data source view click the column and row header field at top left, in order to check the entire table.  
Do not release the mouse key, but drag the table without dropping it to the empty table in the workspace.  
Release the mouse key over field A1.  
Now you can edit the contents of the table.  
Save the table with the File - Save as command and under File type select the "Text CSV" filter.  
Filemaker  
Set the Filemaker database properties.  
On your Macintosh, you can import the database format from Filemaker into %PRODUCTNAME.  
Retrieve all records  
Select this field if you want to import all the data records from the Filemaker file.  
Maximum number of data records  
If you select Retrieve all records, you can limit the maximum number of records for very large databases.  
Data Source Administration  
A dialog appears here for organizing the data sources in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Start this dialog to register a new data source in %PRODUCTNAME or to edit the properties of a previously registered data source.  
On the left of the dialog you see a list of the registered data sources.  
The status of each data source in the list is indicated by a symbol:  
unchanged  
marked for deletion  
marked as a new database  
marked for editing of properties  
If you end the dialog with OK or if you click Apply, the checked changes are carried out.  
If you end the dialog with Cancel, no changes are carried out.  
A data source name should only occur once.  
The only exception to this rule is a data source that has been marked for deletion: you can use the name of this for a new data source.  
You can register a new data source by clicking the New data source button or with the New data source command in the context menu.  
In the context menu of an entry you can delete the entry from the list:  
The Redo data source command in the context menu of a data source marked for deletion can reverse this intention.  
In the dialog you can see the following tab pages, which always relate to the database selected in the list on the left:  
On the General tab page you can select a Database type in each case.  
Depending on your selection a further tab page follows with the Name of the database type (see the following hyperlinks).  
An exception is the Spreadsheet entry, that does not have its own tab page.  
There is also a Tables, Queries and links tab page.  
Depending on which database type you select you see one of the following tab pages:  
Spreadsheet  
Use this database type to select a spreadsheet from %PRODUCTNAME Calc or MS Excel as a data source.  
On the Tables tab page you can select from all tables that are not empty and have not been hidden.  
If you want to have an entire sheet as a data source, you must start the data in cell A1; the column title must appear in row 1.  
If data ranges have been defined in the spreadsheet, you can select any data range as your own database table.  
The data can only be read, not written.  
Execute SQL statement  
The SQL command in a database context menu opens a dialog for direct input of an SQL command for database administration.  
The command entered does not lead to the display of filtered database content, the dialog is used only for input of administration commands such as Grant, Create Table, Drop Table, and so on.  
The data source must support these SQL commands - dBase, for example, cannot execute all the commands mentioned here for SQL.  
A special status window indicates if the command has been successfully executed.  
In order to execute an SQL query for filtering data from a database, open Query Draft.  
command to execute  
Enter the SQL statement in this field.  
In the opened "Bibliography" data source you can, for example, enter the following SQL command:  
SELECT "Address" FROM "biblio" "biblio"  
To obtain more comprehensive information on SQL commands, please consult the relevant literature on this subject.  
Previous commands  
Here you see the previous commands.  
If you select a command, it is transferred to the Command to execute box.  
Status  
The SQL server status reports, created after the processing of the SQL statement are displayed here.  
If errors are found in the SQL syntax, you'll receive an indication where to search for the error.  
Run  
Click run to start the entered command.  
Tables  
Here you will find a list of all tables that belong to the current database.  
In the list box click the mouse in the associated check boxes to select which tables are to be shown in %PRODUCTNAME.  
It is also possible to edit the table structure, define new tables and delete tables.  
Tables from databases that support catalogs or schemes are displayed in a hierarchical representation.  
You can sort the tables using the context menu.  
New table design  
Starts the Table Design window for creating a new table.  
Edit Table  
Starts the Table Design window for editing the selected table.  
Delete table  
Deletes the selected table after a confirm overwrite  
Filters  
This is where you control which tables are to be shown in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Mark the tables in the Filter list box.  
If you check a superordinate entry, the entry is displayed in bold and all subordinate entries are automatically selected as well.  
This is also selected.  
If you only check all the subordinate entries that are immediately visible, the superordinate entry is not shown in bold.  
This means, for example for subsequently added tables, that they are initially not selected.  
Display version columns (when available)  
Some databases, for example Adabas, execute an internal data field with a version number for each record.  
If the record is changed, the version number is incremented by 1.  
If you have checked this box you can see the internal version number of the record in the database table.  
In the table context menu, you will find the following commands:  
Sort Ascending  
Sorts the table in ascending order based on the table names.  
Sort Descending  
Sorts the table in descending order based on the table names.  
JDBC  
This is where you define special settings for a database accessed via JDBC.  
The driver classes must be entered in the java.ini file or by choosing Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Security in the Class path field.  
JDBC Driver Class  
To create the link to the database a JDBC driver is required that must be specified here.  
URL  
Enter here the connection to the database, for example, MySql-JDBC-Driver "jdbc:mysql://<Servername>/<DB-Name>" where "Servername" refers to the name of the server and DB-Name to the name of the database.  
In your driver's documentation, you'll receive more information about your driver.  
Adabas D  
This is where sign on to a database in the Adabas format.  
In order to do this you need to enter your user name and password.  
More information about the Adabas D database format.  
Use up to a maximum of 18 characters to define the user name.  
The password must be contain at least 3 characters and be no longer than 18.

This example accesses the ODBC driver as provider.  
Only 18 characters are allowed for the user name.  
The password should be from 3 to 18 characters long.  
Adabas D Statistics  
Access options are defined here for administering a database in Adabas format.  
Special rights for changing tables can be issued by the Administrator in the Properties dialog of a table.  
Data Buffer Size  
You can change the size of the data buffer of the database here.  
The new size is available after restarting the database.  
Increment size  
This is where you modify the increment size by which the database is automatically increase if it is too small for the data requested.  
The new size is available after the database has been restarted.  
The database provided with %PRODUCTNAME is restricted to 100 MB.  
Control User Name  
Enter the user name of the Control User into this space.  
Control Password  
Enter the password of the Control User into this field.  
Shut down the service when closing %PRODUCTNAME

Queries  
This is where all queries for the current database are listed.  
You can only start this tab page for a newly created data source if you have first saved the changes in the Tools - Data Sources dialog.  
A dialog advises you of this and offers to save the changes for you.  
Queries  
Organize in the list box and start the queries on the current data source.  
New query design  
This is where you create a new query.  
You see the Query Design window.

This is where you clear the selected query.  
Rename  
Opens the Insert As dialog.  
Query name  
Enter the name of the query.  
Links  
Here all links to the current data source that have been entered are listed as Form documents.  
Forms and links  
In %PRODUCTNAME you have access to the data sources that you register and administer under Tools - Data sources.  
On the right of the Data source view (F4) you see the data in tabular form and on the left, in the database explorer, the data sources with your links, queries and tables.  
You can assign your documents, e.g. text documents or spreadsheets, as a data source Link.  
This serves exclusively to provide, from the data source view, easy access to the documents - a further connection between document and data source is indeed possible, but is unnecessary.  
In your documents, irrespective of whether you create a link or not, by using the Field commands Field commands and/or Form functions you can also make reference to the current contents in each case of the data fields of a data source.  
For example, with the form functions you can create any forms.  
Any text document or spreadsheet can contain data source contents.  
You can add these and other documents as links in the data source view, in order to access these documents more easily from the data source view.  
This administration of links is at your discretion.  
Links  
In the list box you can administer the links to the current data source.  
New link  
Create a new link here.  
You see the Document - Link - New dialog:  
Name  
Enter the name of the link.  
URL  
Enter the URL here or select it after clicking....  
Edit link  
This is where you edit the selected link.  
You see the Document - Link - Edit dialog, that corresponds to the Document - Link - New dialog.  
Delete link  
Here delete the selected link.  
Only the assignment of this document to the data source is deleted, not the document itself.  
Open document  
Opens the document specified in the selected link as read-only.  
Edit document  
Opens the document specified in the selected link for editing.  
New form  
Opens a new document of the selected document type.  
Add the form fields or field commands you want and save the document.  
It is automatically entered as a link.  
LDAP  
This is where you enter the settings for an LDAP Server, that you have registered as Address book database type.  
Host name  
Enter the name of the LDAP server here, (for example, in the form: ldap.server.com).  
DN base  
This is where you enter the additional parameters that the LDAP server needs, e.g. in the form: dc=com.  
Port number  
389.  
Records (max.)  
Here you can enter the maximum number of records to be loaded during access to the LDAP server.  
Adabas D Database  
A slightly restricted version is supplied with %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can obtain further information on Adabas, additional help files and ordering options for higher versions from the manufacturer at http://www.adabas.com.  
The Adabas database server must be attainable if you want to work with an Adabas database.  
If you are not accessing an Adabas database server located on the network, but working with a stand-alone computer you first need to install the Adabas database server and start it.  
The Adabas database server supplied with %PRODUCTNAME can be installed by using the appropriate separate installation program.  
The Setup program for installing Adabas D automatically starts after the %PRODUCTNAME Setup program as long as you run a stand-alone installation.  
Read the Installation's Guide for more information on the Adabas installation  
Properties of the %PRODUCTNAME version of Adabas  
Adabas D Version 11, supplied with %PRODUCTNAME, is restricted to a maximum size of 100 MB databases.  
When the database is being used in a network, a maximum of three users will be able to access the database simultaneously.  
Further information can be found in the License.txt file located in your Adabas directory after the installation has been completed.  
Adabas is available in both, the standard installation and the customized installation in the Setup program of %PRODUCTNAME.  
It is also possible to deselect the installation of Adabas in the customized setup of %PRODUCTNAME.  
Adabas should not be installed in the %PRODUCTNAME directory but in one directory of its own.  
Adabas and %PRODUCTNAME can be separately deinstalled if required.  
This variable refers to the directory where Adabas has been installed.  
You will therefore have to restart your computer before using Adabas for the first time.  
If the environment variable DBROOT is found at the time of installation Adabas will not be offered for installation as the setup program assumes that Adabas has already been installed.  
You can enter and edit your data in the database with the help of %PRODUCTNAME or use SQL commands to control the database.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Adabas supports the commands in accordance with the SQL92 standard.  
The performance values of Adabas D in %PRODUCTNAME  
%PRODUCTNAME can access an Adabas D database if the latter has a version number 11.02 or higher.  
The following values apply to the Adabas D version 11 under %PRODUCTNAME:  
Restricted to a max. of 100 MB and 3 users per database.  
Adabas D supports the following data types:  
Data type  
Content  
CHAR (N) N <= 254  
Character string in ASCII or EBCDIC Code or as BYTE.  
VARCHAR (N) N <= 254  
The internal filing of CHAR values is carried out up to a length of 30 in a fixed format.  
Larger CHAR values are always saved internally with a variable length representation.  
CHAR values with a length of less than 30 can also be kept in a variable length representation by entering the data type VARCHAR.  
BOOLEAN  
For differentiating between "existent/non-existent" or "true/false".  
DATE  
The internal format used is YYYYMMDD.  
The external representation can be configured.  
TIME  
TIME values are stored internally in the form HHMMSS.  
The external representation can be configured in a similar way as the the DATE values.  
DATE and TIME values are special CHAR values.  
This means that not only the date and time functions but also all functions can be used on CHAR values.  
TIMESTAMP  
TIMESTAMP values are always internally stored in the YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmmuuu format.  
These are a combination of a DATE and a TIME value and have been enhanced with the values for milliseconds and microseconds.  
As well as being used as a time stamp the TIMESTAMP values can also be used for time arithmetic, as day overflows do not need to be handled by the user.  
TIMESTAMP values are special CHAR values.  
This means that they can also be used on all CHAR values and not just in date and time functions.  
FIXED (N,M)  
There is a decimal fixed comma representation with a maximum of 18 characters for numerical values.  
FLOAT (N)  
A decimal floating point representation with a maximum accuracy of 18 characters is also available.  
LONG  
For saving unformatted data (BLOBs) Adabas offers the data type LONG which can take up to 2.1 GB of data per column.  
Not only is CHAR columns supported but also the variants ASCII, EBCDIC and BYTE.  
This means that Adabas is able to manage extensive information in text, graphics or speech form in the appropriate way.  
The additonal data types existing in other SQLMODEs are understood by Adabas and are mapped to the data types listed above.  
Creating a New Adabas Database  
Use the Create New Adabas Database dialog to create a new Adabas database.  
You can call up this dialog in the following way, for example:  
Choose Tools - Data source to open the Administrate Data Sources dialog.  
In the Database type field select the "Adabas" database type.  
Click the New database button.  
%PRODUCTNAME has already filled a lot of fields in the dialog with values so that you usually only have to enter the name of the database and the name and password of the Administrator.  
These three details are, however, imperative.  
Deleting an Adabas Database  
If you delete the database entry in %PRODUCTNAME, you only delete the access to the data from %PRODUCTNAME.  
The "actual" files of the database remain intact.  
To really delete all the files proceed as follows:  
This is not necessarily the name of the entry.  
Open the context menu and choose Properties.  
The name of the database is in the Data Source field on the Type tab.  
Determine which directories are referred to by the system variables DBCONFIG and DBWORK.  
Under Unix these variables are defined in a Start script.  
Delete the three files with the database name in the $DBCONFIG$ directory.  
If you have named the database TEST for example, you would delete the following three files:  
C:\Adabas\Sql\Test.sys, Test.trs and Test.dat.  
Delete a file that has the same name as the database in the directory $DBCONFIG$\Config.  
If you have named the database TEST for example, you would delete the file:  
C:\Adabas\Sql\Config\Test.  
Delete an entire directory with the name of the database in the $DBWORKS$\Wrk directory.  
If you have named your database TEST for example, you would delete the directory C:\Adabas\Sql\Wrk\Test.  
Make sure that you only delete those files or directories where their name corresponds to that of the database.  
Starting and Closing an Adabas Database  
NoDBService  
switches the database to COLD.  
xutil -d<DBNAME> -u <CONTROLUSER>,<CONTROLPASSWORD> shutdown  
switches the database to COLD.  
xutil -d<DBNAME> -u <CONTROLUSER>,<CONTROLPASSWORD> restart  
switches the database to WARM.  
stp -d<DBNAME> -NoDBService  
completely shuts down the database  
Error Messages in an Adabas Database  
Here are the error messages that might occur while working with Adabas D.  
The database cannot be shut down / restarted as a user is still connected to it.  
Close any other open tasks that show the database contents.  
With multi-user systems, you should prompt all users to leave the database.  
If that does not help either, you need to close %PRODUCTNAME and restart.  
Client unable to establish connection; -813 SERVERDB MUST BE RESTARTED  
This error occurs if you try to access an Adabas D database which hasn't been started.  
The Control user in the Properties of the database must be however entered.  
The Control user will be defined when setting up the database.  
Client unable to establish connection; -8022 USER ALREADY CONNECTED  
This error occurs if you try to access an Adabas D database, but the same user is already linked to the database.  
Errors occurring when writing the data in the database  
If an error message like this appears, you must close and restart %PRODUCTNAME.  
Then immediately change the database properties.  
Adabas Server in the Network  
The Adabas Server runs on a network computer in the shared database applications in a network, whereas only the Adabas Client runs on the Workstations.  
Remote Connection  
To enable a Remote connection, the support program xtcpupd.exe has to be run on both computers (Client and Server).  
The xtcpupd.exe program only exists under Windows.  
The program x_server from the adabas\bin Adabas\bin directory has to be started on the server (all platforms).  
Register a remote connection as a new Adabas database.  
In the Data source text box, enter the name of the external computer, a colon and the name of the external database, e.g. computername: database.  
On the Adabas D tab page enter user name and password and click OK.  
Now you can use the remote database.  
If you create a new database on a Remote Server, there are two possibilities:  
You could install a %PRODUCTNAME on the Remote Server and create the new database locally or,  
use the Adabas Tools for creating a new Adabas database on the Server.  
It is not possible to create the new database from a %PRODUCTNAME Client.  
Create New Adabas Database  
Use this dialog to create a new Adabas database.  
Database name  
This is where you enter the name of the database in Adabas.  
Following confirmation of the dialog this name is transferred to the Data source URL field.  
User settings  
Enter the user settings here. %PRODUCTNAME has already filled in the fields with the default settings.  
Administrator  
Enter the name of the database Administrator in this field.  
When an Adabas database is being created for the first time, you must enter at least one Administrator name and a password.  
The Administrator is also the first user.  
The Adabas version supplied with %PRODUCTNAME allows three users simultaneously.  
You will only see this field if you have called the dialog via New Data Source.  
User control  
The control user has the right to modify some parameters of the database.  
Normally, the default settings for name and password of the control user remain unchanged.  
The control user exists regardless of the 3-user limitation.  
User domain  
The user Domain is internally used by Adabas.  
Normally, the default settings for the name and password remain unchanged.  
The Domain user exists regardless of the 3-user limit.  
You can only see this field, if you've called the dialog via the New Data Source... button.  
Password  
This password will also be used for the Control user and Domain user.  
These passwords can also differ from one another.  
Database settings  
Enter the database settings here. %PRODUCTNAME has already filled in most fields with the appropriate default settings.  
DEVSPACEs are drives containing parts of the Serverdb.  
Adabas recommends to store each of the DEVSPACEs on another disk to improve performance.  
The file paths, including file names, should not exceed 40 characters.  
SYSDEVSPACE  
Enter the destination of the Devspace system.  
Among other things, the configuration data will be managed in this Devspace.  
The size of the Devspace system depends on the size of the database.  
TRANSACTIONLOG  
Enter the location of the transaction log file.  
All modifications made to the data base will be recorded in Log and overwritten when the transaction is over.  
The Log transaction is used for the transaction's rollback and will be cyclically written.  
Its size should be enough for including all modifications of all open transactions.  
DATADEVSPACE  
Enter the location of the Data Devspace here.  
The user data (tables, indexes) and the SQL catalog (Schema info) will be stored in the Data Devspaces.  
The data contained in one table will be evenly distributed on all Data Devspaces.  
The disk space defined by all Data Devspaces shows the size of the database.  
The Data Devspace is limited to 100MB depending on the database in the %PRODUCTNAME Adabas version.  
If you need a higher capacity, please refer to the Adabas producer (Software AG, www.adabas.com).  
If Data Devspaces is used in its full capacity the database operation will be terminated and Adabas executes an emergency shutdown.  
The database will be then automatically increased (up to 100 MB) and restarted again.  
All saved data will not be lost.  
...  
This is where you open a dialog for saving the Adabas system file for the current database.  
Select a directory and enter the name.  
Transaction file (MB)  
Select here the size of the transaction file in megabytes.  
Database size (MB)  
Select the size of the database in megabytes here.  
The size is limited to 100 MB in the %PRODUCTNAME Adabas version.  
Data buffer size (MB)  
Select the data buffer size (data cache) in megabytes here.  
This cache keeps the Pages of the Data Devspaces, which were last accessed either in reading or writing.  
The Data Cache will be simultaneously used by all active users.  
The hit rate or in other words, the relation between the successful and unsuccessful accesses to the Data Cache is of decisive importance for the performance.  
A successful access means that the needed data was already present in the Data Cache.  
General  
This tab page lists the general properties of the current object.  
General information means the name of the object and information about it.  
Only the information or contents for the special object apply.  
Name  
The name shown for the object is displayed in the text box.  
If no name has been assigned, enter a new name here.  
With certain objects, you can also modify an existing name.  
When you create a database, enter the name by which the database will be registered in %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can enter any name, but certain characters are not allowed (e.g. /,\,?, #) and will be ignored if you type them.  
Only operating-system specific limitations of the file systems apply.  
If you are working on a network, the designations of the local databases cannot be identical to those on a network drive.  
For example, to create a new form for a database on a network drive, %PRODUCTNAME can set this up for the database only if there is no database with the same name on your local hard drive.  
Read-only  
Mark this check box to protect the document from being edited.  
Unmark it to overwrite or edit a read-only file.  
This check box is visible when you look at the properties of a file, e.g. in a folder.  
This box is not visible in the properties dialog of an opened document.

In the Gallery you will find many graphics in directories ordered according to themes; You can also easily add more graphicssounds and folders, which are called here Themes.  
Themes are shown on the left.  
For each theme that you click you see the objects it contains shown on the right.  
Use drag and drop to copy images between gallery and document.  
You can toggle the view of the objects between icon view and list view.  
Double-click an object or press the space bar to switch between a view of several objects and of a single object.  
Adding New Themes to the Gallery  
Click the New Theme button.  
General and Files.  
If in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths you have added a further gallery path, you can only edit the gallery themes in the additional path.  
You can, for example in the original path, load and see the themes on the company server but not inadvertently change these, and in the additional path you can create, edit and delete your own themes.  
New theme  
Adds a new theme to the Gallery.  
In the Properties of (New Theme) dialog, you can enter a name for the theme on the General tab page and add new files on the Files tab page.  
You can also open the context menu of the theme on the left in the Gallery window and choose Properties and add new files to the Files tab page.

supported audioservers  
Network Audio System (and supported audio hardware).  
NAS is freely available and can be purchased from ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/contrib/audio or Mirrors.  
Version 1.2, release 4 or higher is required.  
NAS is also a component part of X11R6 but is not bundled by all manufacturers.  
Systems currently supported by NAS:  
Linux x86 (provided audio drivers are available for the card), SGI, HP, SUN.  
This concerns only the audio server, i.e. the computer, that is to play the sounds, ("the one with the speakers").  
They can activate any NAS audio server irrespective of the hardware on which it runs.  
Before the application is started, the audioserver must be specified as AUDIOSERVER in the environmental variables; the format is exactly like the DISPLAY variables, e.g. name:0  
If AUDIOSERVER is not set, the DISPLAY variable is used (therefore audio and video are on the same host).  
If the DISPLAY variable is not set either (e.g. the display is indicated via the command line), audio is not possible. (The audioserver cannot be indicated via the command line.)  
Alternatively, you can use rplayd for playing sounds.  
There can only be one audioserver active at any one time.  
If you work with rplayd, audio can no longer be heard under KDE, for example, because KDE uses its own audioserver.  
It is best to start rplayd before starting X Window.  
Furthermore, you can output sounds with SalSound and with the OSS (Open Sound System) on the local display.  
Only *.wav files can be played on OSS at present; *.au and *.snd will follow later.  
Files  
This is where you add new files on the selected theme.  
File Type  
Select the file type to search for.  
If you choose <All Files>, all files organized in the Gallery are included in the search.

First Steps  
How to simplify your work using Samples and Templates.  
%PRODUCTNAME comes with a large number of sample documents and templates.  
You can access these by choosing File - New - Styles and documents or via the shortcut keys (Shift) (Command) (Ctrl) (N).  
If you call up one of the templates, a new document is created based on this template.  
Use the various AutoPilots (under File menu) to create user-defined templates, for example, for faxes, presentations or web pages which you can use as a basis for further documents.  
Use the provided templates directly or to learn the techniques in working with %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you design a bulletin, write a book or administrate your finances, forms or contracts or even design a CD Cover, you'll definitely find that %PRODUCTNAME has the desired template for these and many more tasks.

Turning Extended Tips on and off  
The Extended Tips function shows you not only the function name but also a brief description of the function, when you allow the cursor to pause over a button, another control or an icon.  
To turn Extended Tips on and off permanently:  
On the menu bar of the application, click Help and select Extended Tips.  
A tick against the menu item indicates that the Extended Tips function is enabled.  
To turn Extended Tips on temporarily:  
Press the shortcut keys (Shift)(F1) to enable Extended Tips once.  
A question mark appears beside the mouse pointer.  
You can move this Help Mouse Pointer over all controls, icons and menu items to obtain a short description of the command in question.  
The Help Mouse Pointer is disabled the next time you click the mouse.  
Turning off URL Recognition by AutoCorrect  
When you enter text, %PRODUCTNAME automatically recognizes a word that may be a URL and replaces the word with a hyperlink. %PRODUCTNAME formats the hyperlink with direct font attributes (color and underline) the properties of which are obtained from certain Character Styles.  
If you do not want %PRODUCTNAME to automatically recognize URLs as you are typing, there are several ways of turning off this feature.  
Undo URL recognition  
When you are typing and notice that a text has just been automatically converted into a hyperlink, press Command Ctrl +Z to undo this formatting.  
If you do not notice this conversion until later, select the hyperlink and choose Format - Default.  
Turn off URL recognition  
Load a document of the type for which you want to modify the URL recognition.  
If you want to modify the URL recognition for text documents, open a text document.  
Choose Tools - AutoCorrect. (In %PRODUCTNAME Writer, choose Tools - AutoCorrect/AutoFormat.)  
In the AutoCorrect dialog, select the Options tab.  
If you unmark URL Recognition, words will no longer be automatically replaced with hyperlinks.  
The field in the first column is for later post-editing and the field in the second column is for AutoCorrect as you type.  
Showing, Hiding and Docking Windows  
Like the Gallery, Navigator and Stylist, windows can be temporarily hidden instead of you having to constantly move them or open and close them.  
When a window is shown, you can choose to have it covering the current document, or sharing the space on the screen with the current document.  
Docking windows and making them into free windows  
You have two options:  
Hold down (Ctrl) and drag the window by its title bar to the side.  
Keep (Ctrl) pressed and double-click on a vacant area of the window, or on a place in the gray area of the window not containing any icon.  
This method can also be used to turn a docked window back into a free window.  
Showing and hiding docked windows  
On the edge of a docked window is a button with a pin.  
This is used to toggle the "floating" behavior.  
The button allows you to choose whether the docked window should be "squashed" when the current document is shown, so that both can be shown together, or whether the document underneath it should be covered over temporarily.  
If you do not use the arrow button to show the document, but simply click on the visible edge of the docked window, it will only be shown temporarily.  
The temporarily shown window will be hidden as soon as you move the mouse pointer some way away from it.  
This AutoHide function operates no matter whether the window is shown in fixed or floating mode.  
If it is the active window, i.e. if you clicked in it, single-click somewhere away from this window to hide it again.  
If it is not the active window, it is hidden automatically.  
The behavior described in this section also applies to other windows such as Navigator, Stylist, Gallery or the Preview window in %PRODUCTNAME Impress.  
When these windows are docked and you showed them by clicking on the edge of the window in order to use the AutoHide function, simply click in the current document to hide the window again.  
The AutoHide function works for each of the four window edges, for all windows docked to that edge.  
Defining Background Colors or Background Graphics  
You can define a background color for different objects.  
With certain objects you can even use a graphic as the background.

8.  
Now select the middle column of the table and again open the Table Format dialog by choosing Table in the context menu.  
9.  
Under Line arrangement, click the areas representing the right and left lines (see illustration).  
10.  
In the Style field select the required line thickness and click OK.  
11.  
Select the bottom row of the table and again open the Table Format dialog by choosing Table in the context menu.  
12.  
In the Style field select the required line thickness, previously 2.50 pt, and in Line arrangement click the areas representing the top and bottom lines.  
13.  
Now the table is finished.  
Borders tab page  
Changing the Title of a Document  
On the title bar, amongst other information, %PRODUCTNAME shows the title of the current document.  
When you create and save a document for the first time, the title is the same as the file name.  
This is how to change the title of the current document  
Choose File - Properties.  
This opens the Properties of dialog.  
Select the Description tab.  
Enter the title in the Title box and click OK.  
Properties of  
Editing Chart Axes  
Suppose you have inserted a chart in a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document and you want to change the scale of the vertical Y axis.  
Double-click on the chart.  
A gray border appears around the chart and the menu bar now contains commands for editing the objects in the chart.  
Choose Format - Axis - Y axis if you want to edit the Y axis, or double-click on the Y axis.

Inserting Charts  
1.  
Open an existing spreadsheet or enter data in a new sheet with row and column headings.  
2.  
Select the data together with the headings.  
3.  
Long-click the Insert Object icon found in the Main toolbar to display the floating toolbar.  
Then click the Insert Chart icon and the cursor will change to a cross-hair symbol with a small chart symbol.  
4.  
In the spreadsheet document, open a selection rectangle defining the location and size of the chart.  
5.  
You can also simply click the Create button to create a chart with the default settings.  
This example shows the number of times people of different age groups in various cities go to the movie theater annually.  
If you would rather put the age groups than the towns on the horizontal axis, you can "tilt" the chart subsequently:  
As long as the chart remains selected, the main toolbar contains a Data in Columns icon.  
Click on it.  
You are free to make other changes to the individual elements of the chart.  
You can either double-click on the individual parts of the chart or, with the chart selected, choose the individual functions from the Format menu.  
For example, if you double-click on the color preview in the legend, you can automatically reformat all relevant data points.  
On the other hand, if you click on the background in the box of the legend, you just format the background to the legend.  
If you created the chart from the data of a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet, the data series that you click on in the chart are highlighted.  
Suppose you placed the chart in your %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet in the background, and now you are wondering how to select it for further editing.  
Open the Show Draw Functions floating toolbar and select the first tool, the Select arrow.  
This allows you to click on the chart.  
In a %PRODUCTNAME Calc chart, you can move a data series forwards or backwards.  
You can arrange the series in such a way that the lowest 3D representations are as far forward as possible and the higher ones further back.  
To change the arrangement in the chart, use a command in the context menu of a data series or choose Format - Order.  
The output data in the %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet will not be rearranged.  
When you insert a chart in a presentation or drawing document with the Insert - Insert Chart floating toolbar, it is displayed with a set of sample data.  
If you want to insert a chart in a spreadsheet, you have to select the cells in the spreadsheet whose values should be displayed in the chart.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Writer documents too, you can insert a chart obtained from the data of a %PRODUCTNAME Writer table.  
If you have not selected any data in a %PRODUCTNAME Writer table, choosing Insert - Object - Chart also inserts a chart containing sample data in %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
You can change the values in a chart containing sample data by double-clicking on the chart and then choosing Edit - Chart Data.  
If you want to change the values of a chart obtained from selected data, you have to alter the values in the cells of the table.  
If the chart is in a text document, press (F9) to update the chart.  
Modification of chart data is also possible if you, for example, have copied a chart from a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document into a %PRODUCTNAME Writer document and now double-click the chart in the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document.  
Remember, however, you are only editing the copy and not the original document.  
You can change the type of chart subsequently.  
When you double-click on the chart and choose Format - Chart Type, a dialog appears, presenting you with various types to choose from.  
You can also switch between 2D and 3D representation.  
With the Columns chart type you can select a Combination Chart of lines and columns.  
The three-dimensional representations make special effects possible.  
In 3D charts, you can even adjust the illumination settings, such as light source, ambient light and the color filter.  
3D charts can be rotated and flipped with the mouse for optimal design.  
By choosing Insert - Statistics, you can apply statistical indicators to XY charts, such as standard deviations, with regression curves and more besides.  
A single or double logarithmic representation of the axes can also be set here.  
In line charts you can work with various icons.  
You can also select them yourself from graphic files or from the Gallery.

This dictionary cannot be a "negative dictionary".  
The language of the dictionary has to be set up on "All".  
The dictionary file cannot be a read-only file.  
Tools - Configure  
Configuring Menus  
Integrating a scanner requires a scanner driver compatible with your operating system.  
Currently, %PRODUCTNAME supports the integration of TWAIN drivers under Windows and SANE drivers under Unix.  
The method for integrating commands into a %PRODUCTNAME menu shown here can also be used for other functions.  
%PRODUCTNAME modules include scanning menu commands that let you edit graphics.  
The commands work only if you have a TWAIN-compatible driver for your scanner or digital camera.  
The following explains how you can integrate scanning commands into the File menu of a text document.  
A TWAIN driver is usually integrated into the File menu.  
A new item called "Scan" should appear, as well as two subitems called "Select Source" and "Scan In".  
The dialogs and functions associated with these items are on the TWAIN driver; %PRODUCTNAME only gives you access to them.  
Open a text document.  
Choose Tools - Configure.  
The Configuration dialog appears.  
Click the Menu tab.  
In the large list box, click the command into which you want to integrate the new scan command (e.g. "Last Version").  
Click the New Menu button.  
A new item called "Menu" appears under the last selected item.  
The subordinate item appears as a dash.  
Click the new entry ("Menu") twice Right-click the new entry ("Menu") and enter the new name ("Scan").  
Click the subordinate item (i.e. the dash).  
Any new menu item you define here is included as a submenu for scanning.  
Select the "Insert" function in the left list box and the "Scan Source" function in the right list box.  
The new menu command is inserted in the large list box.  
Select the "Scan Request" function in the right list box and click New.  
This item is also inserted.  
Click the dash and then Delete to remove it.  
You can rename the two submenu items if you want (by right-clicking the items).  
You can change the order of the items by moving the names to the large list box using Drag&Drop.  
Click OK to close the Configure dialog. %PRODUCTNAME automatically saves the changes.  
The new menu items are now available.  
Tools - Configure  
Configuring %PRODUCTNAME  
You can customize your %PRODUCTNAME to suit your needs.  
You can delete items, add new ones, copy items from one menu to another, rename them, and so on.  
The toolbars may be freely configured.  
You can drag and drop icons (in Windows) while holding down the (Alt) key.  
You can change the shortcut keys as you want.  
To change these, choose Tools - Configure to open the Configuration dialog.  
Tools - Configure  
Saving Configuration With Document  
You can set a global configuration (so that it applies to all documents of this type), or you can connect the configuration to a specific document, which must exist as a file.  
Load the document you want to connect to the configuration or open any document of the same type.  
Set the configuration.  
For example, select the toolbars you want to have visible or define what is on the toolbars, menus or status bar, etc.  
Click Save... in the dialog under Tools - Configure.  
Another dialog appears in which you can save the configuration.  
In the File Type list box, select<All>.  
In the large list box of the Save dialog, select the file you want to connect to the configuration.  
Click Save.  
A prompt appears, asking whether you want to replace the file or not.  
This query concerns only the configuration connected to the document, not the "actual" contents of the document.  
Confirm overwrite.  
The configuration is now connected to the active document.  
You can check this by loading the document and choosing File - Document Template - Organizer then double-clicking the document.  
As soon as you load or open this document, the configuration saved therein becomes active.  
The global default configuration is restored when you load or open another document that does not contain custom configuration information.  
You can select manual settings at any time by choosing Tools - Configure and clicking the Reset button.  
Tools - Configure  
Copying Draw Objects into Other Documents  
In %PRODUCTNAME it is possible to directly copy draw objects between text, spreadsheets and presentation documents.  
Select the draw object or objects.  
Copy the draw object to the clipboard, for example, by using (Command) (Ctrl) (C).  
Switch to the other document and place the cursor where the draw object is to be inserted.  
Insert the draw object to the target position, for example, by using (Command) (Ctrl) (V).  
Inserting in a text document  
An inserted draw object is anchored in a text document at the current paragraph.  
You can change the anchor by selecting the object and clicking on the Change Anchor icon on the object bar.  
This opens a popup menu where you can change the possible types of anchor.  
Inserting in a spreadsheet  
An inserted draw object is anchored to a spreadsheet in the current cell.  
You can change the anchor between cell and page and back by selecting the object and clicking on the Change Anchor on the object bar.  
Inserting Data From Spreadsheets  
If you only want to copy the contents of a cell (text or numbers), use the clipboard.  
You can even copy formulas that are in the cells into the clipboard (e.g., from the input lines of the formula bar) so that they can then be inserted into a text.  
If you want to copy a simple, rectangular area of cells into a text document as a sheet, select the cells in the sheet and then use either the clipboard or drag & drop to insert them into the text document.  
You will then find an OLE object in the text document which you can edit further if you want.  
If you drag cells to the character view of a presentation document, they will also re-appear there as OLE objects.  
Once dragged into the outline view, each cell will form a line of the outline view.  
Dragging using drag-and-drop will move the cells.  
Only if you press the shift key when dragging, will it be copied.  
Inserting Data From Text Documents  
You can transfer text into other document types such as spreadsheets and presentations.  
We make a distinction depending on whether the text should be set in its own text frame or whether it should be transferred into a spreadsheet cell or into the structure of a presentation.  
If you transfer text via the clipboard, you can paste it to the destination with or without text attributes.  
Use the shortcut keys (Command) (Ctrl) (C) to copy and (Command) (Ctrl) (V) to paste.  
To select the format in which the clipboard contents will be pasted, do a long click on the Paste icon on the function bar.  
Select the format from the submenu.  
To obtain a selection of formats, choose Edit - Paste Special.  
In a text document you will find in the File menu the command Send - Outline to presentation.  
A new presentation document is created, that contains the headings from the text document as the outline.  
You must have formatted the headings with a corresponding Paragraph Style to be able to see this command.  
If you want to also transfer the same headings to the first superordinate paragraph (or several paragraphs) of the text, then select the AutoAbstract to presentation command.  
You must have formatted the headings with a corresponding Paragraph Style to be able to see this command.  
Copying Text Using Drag and Drop  
If you select a text section and drag it into a spreadsheet with drag & drop, it will be inserted as text into the cell where you release the mouse.  
If you drag a text section to the character view of a presentation, an OLE object is inserted as a %PRODUCTNAME plugin.  
If you drag the text to the outline view of a presentation, it will be inserted where the cursor is.  
Registering an Address Book  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can register different data sources.  
The contents of the data fields are then available to you, in fields and controls for example.  
The address book which perhaps you already use on your system is such a data source, e.g. an LDAP server or a Netscape address book.  
In the templates and AutoPilots from %PRODUCTNAME, fields are used for the contents of the address book.  
When you activate those fields, the general fields we have used in the templates are automatically replaced with the actual fields used in your system.  
In order for the replacement to take place, you must tell %PRODUCTNAME which address book you use.  
The dialog asking for this information appears automatically the first time you, for example, activate a business letter template.  
You can also call the dialog by following the steps listed below.  
Address Data Source AutoPilot  
To call this AutoPilot, choose File - AutoPilot - Address Data Source.  
This AutoPilot is described in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Manual Registration of Existing Address Book  
1.  
Choose File - Templates - Address Book Source.

2.  
In the Data source box, select the system address book or the data source you want to use as address book.  
If you have not yet registered the system address book in %PRODUCTNAME as the data source, click the Administrate button.  
This takes you to the Administrate Data Sources dialog, in which you can register your address book as a new data source in %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can read further how to do this under System address book as data source.  
3.  
In the Table box, select the database table you want to use as address book.  
4.  
Under Field assignment, you can set the fields for company, department, first name, etc. to the actual field names used in your address book.

Importing and Exporting Data in Text Format  
If you want to exchange data with a database which does not have an ODBC link and which does not allow dBase import and export, it is often possible to exchange the data via a common text format.  
Importing Data Into %PRODUCTNAME  
To exchange data in a text format use the %PRODUCTNAME Calc import/export filter.  
Export the desired data from the source database in a text format.  
The CSV text format is highly recommended since it separates data fields by using commas and records by inserting line breaks.  
Open the data with the "Text CSV" file filter.  
Select this file filter in the Open dialog in the Files of type list box.  
Select the file and click Open.  
You will see the Import text files dialog.  
Here you can decide which data to include from the text document.  
Once the data is in a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet, you can edit it as you want.  
You have two ways of saving the data in a %PRODUCTNAME data source:  
Save the current %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet in dBase format in the folder of a dBase database.  
To do this, choose File - Save As, then select the File Type "dBase" and the folder of the dBase database.  
Check the data range in the %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet and drag the area into a table container in the data source view.  
The table container is the area on the left of the database explorer that is designated "Tables" (see diagram).  
An AutoPilot is started automatically.  
Exporting in CSV Text Format  
You can export the current %PRODUCTNAME spreadsheet in a text format which can be read by many other applications.  
Choose File - Save as.  
In Save as type select the filter "Text CSV".  
Enter a file name and click Save.  
This opens the Export of text files dialog, in which you can select the character set, field delimiter and text delimiter.  
Click OK.  
A warning informs you that only the active sheet was saved.  
Executing an SQL Command Directly  
You can also control a database directly with the help of SQL commands, and you can create and edit spreadsheets, create queries and so on.  
Not all database types support all SQL instructions.  
If necessary, find out which SQL commands are supported by your database system.  
1.  
Open the Administrate Data Sources dialog with Tools - Data Sources.  
2.  
In the list, select the data source which you want to address directly via SQL and select the Query page.  
3.  
Click the Enter New SQL Command icon or  
select an existing query from the list and click the Enter SQL Command icon.  
4.  
In the Query dialog, enter the SQL command that you want to execute or change an existing command according to your requirements.  
5.  
Click the Execute icon.  
The result of the query is displayed in the upper window.  
6.  
Click the Save icon or Save As to save the created or modified query.  
Loading Data from Data Sources in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
If you only want to export certain records from a data source table, select those records by clicking the row headers.  
To select multiple records, press Shift and/or Command Ctrl.  
Instead, drag the selected data into an open %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet.  
You can now save the %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet in the desired format.  
Searching With a Form Filter  
1.  
Open a form.  
Switch off the design mode.  
Just an example:  
Open an empty text document and press F4, open the bibliography database table biblio in the data source view.  
While pressing Shift+Ctrl, drag a few column headers into the document so that the form fields are created there.  
2.  
Turn off the design mode.  
To do this, open the Form Functions floating toolbar and click the Design Mode on/off icon, so that it does not appear to be pressed.  
3.  
On the form toolbar, click the Form-based filters icon.  
The current document is displayed with its inserted form functions as an empty edit mask.  
At the bottom edge you will see the filter bar.  
4.  
Enter the filter conditions into one or several fields.  
Remarks about possible wildcards and operators can be found in the Help about Query Design.  
If you enter filter conditions into several fields they will be joined by the Boolean AND.  
If on the filter bar you click the Apply filter icon, the filtering is performed in the database.  
You see the form bar and can navigate the habitats.  
If you click on the button Close in the filter bar then the form will be displayed without a filter.  
In the form view, click the Apply Filter icon to change to the filtered view.  
The filters that have been set can be removed by clicking on the icon Remove Filter/Sort.  
If you want to connect several filter conditions with OR, click the Filter Navigation icon on the filter bar.  
The dockable Filter Navigator window appears.  
As soon as a filter is set, at the bottom of the Filter Navigator you will see a blank filter level, which you can select by clicking on the word "Or".  
Once you have selected the blank filter level, you can enter other filter conditions in the form.  
These conditions are linked by Boolean OR to the previously defined conditions.  
The context menu can be called for every entry in the Filter Navigator.  
You can edit the filter conditions in this area directly as text.  
In addition you can also select the filter conditions (SQL:"Is Null ") or (SQL:" Is not Null ") if you wish to check if a field has content or not.  
It is also possible to delete the entry by using the context menu.  
You are able to move the filter conditions within a form in the Filter Navigator by Drag&Drop or copy them by holding down the Command Crtl Key.  
Searching in Tables and Form Documents  
In spreadsheets and documents in which form functions are used, you can click the Find Record icon to open a dialog to find any text and values.  
Use the icon at the bottom of the form bar, not the similar looking icon on the main toolbar on the left.  
You can search in all data records or in all data fields.  
You can select whether the text must be at the beginning, end or any location of the data field.  
You also can use the? and * wildcards, as in the Find and Replace dialog.  
You can find additional information about the database search function in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Table Design  
Here you will see how to create a new database table in the design view.  
Open the data source browser (F4).  
Open a data source by clicking the plus sign in front of the name.  
You see the tables container, called "Tables".  
Right-click the table name to open the context menu.  
Choose New Table Design to create a new table.  
In the Design view, you can now create the fields for your table.  
Enter new fields from top to bottom rowwise.  
Click the cell at the far left and enter a field name for each data field.  
In the adjacent cell to the right, define the field type.  
When you click in the cell, you can select a field type in the drop down list box  
Each field can only accept data corresponding to the specified field type.  
It is not possible to enter text, for example, in a number field.  
Memo fields in dBase III format are references to internally-managed text files which can hold up to 64KB text.  
If you wish, you can also enter an optional Description for each field.  
The text of the description will appear as a tip on the column headings in the table view.  
Field Properties  
Enter properties for each selected data field.  
Depending on the database type, it is possible that not all input facilities are available.  
In the Default box, enter the contents that you want to have entered for every new record.  
This can, of course, be subsequently modified.  
In the Entry required box, specify whether or not the field may remain empty.  
No matter which field type, a list box provides the available types  
If you want to change the name or type of a data field subsequently, please note that the table itself many not be opened during this modification; only the design view may be opened.  
Saving Documents Automatically  
To save a backup every time you save a document  
Choose Tools - Options - Load/Save - General.  
Mark Always create backup copy.  
If you save the current document with File - Save or (Ctrl)(S), under the path and file name from which you opened it, the old version will be overwritten by the new version.  
If the Always create backup copy check box is marked, the old version is first copied to the backup directory.  
The backup directory is {installpath}/user/backup {installpath}\user\backup.  
You can change it in the Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths dialog in the "backup" entry.  
The copy has the same name as the document, but the extension is .BAK.  
If the backup folder already contains such a file, it will be overwritten without warning!  
To save automatically every n minutes  
Choose Tools - Options - Load/Save - General.  
Mark AutoSave every and select the time interval in the spin button.  
Mark Prompt to save if you want to be asked prior to automatic saving whether or not you want to save the document.  
This command saves the current document as if you pressed Ctrl+S, for example.  
If the document was saved previously, the old version will be overwritten by the current version.  
At the same time, the backup copy will be replaced by the last version.  
Save As

Drag and Drop With the Data Source View  
The simplest and quickest way of transferring data from a data source into a text or spreadsheet document, or creating forms based on a data source, is the drag-and-drop method.  
Copying with Drag&Drop  
If you make a mistake during drag and drop and want to reverse the function, position the cursor in your document and choose the Undo command from the Edit menu (or via the keyboard).  
Copying by drag and drop is likewise possible in the other direction:  
A text table or a selected range of a spreadsheet can be dragged using drag and drop to a table container in the data source explorer.  
Simpler text can be copied using drag and drop from one document to a data field in the data source view.  
You can read up on how this happens in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Using data in a text document  
You can insert a database field in a text document by dragging a field name from the column header of the data source view into the document.  
This inserts a field for this database field in the document.  
This is especially useful when designing form letters.  
Simply drag the desired fields - home address, form of address etc. - into your document.  
The best way to insert a complete record is to select the corresponding header and drag it into the document.  
When you release the mouse button, the Insert database columns dialog appears, where you can decide whether to use all database fields, and whether to copy the data into the document as text, a table or fields.  
All currently selected records will be inserted.  
Applying data to a table document  
You can insert one or more records into the current sheet of a spreadsheet by selecting the rows in the data source view and dragging and dropping them into the spreadsheet.  
The data is inserted in the place where you release the mouse button.  
Inserting controls in a text form  
When you create a text form linked to a database, you can generate controls by drag-and-drop from the data source view:  
When you drag a database column into the text document, you insert a field.  
If you hold down (Shift) (Command) (Ctrl) while dragging, a text field is inserted, grouped with an appropriate label field.  
The text field already contains all the database information that you need for the form.  
Copying Graphics From the Gallery  
If you drag a graphic from the Gallery into a text, spreadsheet or presentation document, the graphic will be inserted there.  
If you release the graphic directly on a draw object, please note the following:  
If you move it (drag it without pressing any key, in which case no additional symbol appears next to the mouse pointer), only the font attributes are copied from the graphic and applied to the draw object on which you release the mouse button.  
If you copy it (drag it while holding down the (Ctrl) key, in which case a plus sign appears next to the mouse pointer), the graphic will be inserted as an object.  
If you create a hyperlink (drag while holding down (Shift) and (Ctrl), in which case a linking arrow appears next to the mouse pointer), the drawing object is replaced by the graphic from the Gallery, but the position and size of the replaced draw object are retained.  
Inserting Graphics From a Document in the Gallery  
You can place a graphic - from an HTML page, for example - in the Gallery by drag-and-drop.  
Display the Gallery theme that you want to add the graphic to.  
Position your mouse pointer above the graphic, without clicking.  
If the mouse pointer changes to a hand symbol, the graphic refers to a hyperlink.  
In this case, click the graphic while pressing the (Option) (Alt) key to select it without executing the respective link.  
If the mouse pointer does not change to a hand symbol, you can simply click the graphic to select it.  
Click again on the graphic image, keeping the mouse button pressed for more than two seconds, to copy the graphic image to an internal memory.  
Without releasing the mouse button, drag the graphic into the Gallery.  
Draw objects that you have created with the Draw functions floating toolbar, cannot be incorporated in the gallery.  
Copying Graphics Between Documents  
You can copy a graphic from one document to another by drag-and-drop.  
If you plan to publish your document, please observe copyright laws and, for safety, obtain the consent of the authors of the original.  
Open the document in which you want to insert the graphic object.  
Open the document from which you want to copy the graphic.  
Click the graphic while pressing the Option Alt key, to select it without executing any hyperlinks it may refer to.  
Keep the mouse button pressed and wait a moment while the object is copied to your clipboard.  
Drag the graphic into the other document.  
If the documents are not visible side by side, first move the mouse pointer to the button of the target document.  
Keep the mouse button pressed!  
The document in question is then displayed and you can move the mouse pointer into the document.  
Release the mouse button as soon as the gray text cursor indicates the position where you want to insert a copy of the picture.  
If the graphic is connected with a hyperlink, the hyperlink and not the graphic is inserted.  
Copying Sheet Areas to Text Documents  
Open both the text document and the spreadsheet.  
Select the sheet area you want to copy.  
Keep the mouse button pressed for a moment, then drag the area into the text document.  
If the documents are not visible next to each other, first drag the mouse pointer to the destination document button.  
Continue to hold down the mouse button.  
The document addressed in this way is displayed, and you can move the mouse pointer within the document.  
Once the cursor is located in the place where you want to insert the sheet area, release the mouse button.  
The sheet area is inserted as an OLE object.  
You can select and edit the OLE object at any time.  
To edit the OLE object, simply double-click on it.  
Alternatively, select the object and choose Edit - Object - Edit or choose Edit from the context menu.  
You edit the object in its own frame within the text document, but you see the icons and menu commands needed for spreadsheets.  
Choose Open to open the source document of the OLE object.  
Dragging and Dropping Within a %PRODUCTNAME Document  
There are many options for moving or copying objects using drag and drop.  
Selected text, text areas, draw objects, graphics, buttons and other form functions, hyperlinks, table areas and many more can be moved with the mouse.  
Pay attention when dragging using the mouse pointer.  
The mouse pointer shows a plus sign when copying and an arrow when making a link or hyperlink.

Sending Faxes and Configuring %PRODUCTNAME for Faxing  
To send a fax directly from %PRODUCTNAME, you need a fax modem and a fax driver that allows applications to communicate with the fax modem as they would with a printer.  
Sending a Fax via Dialog  
Print the current document with the fax machine as a printer:  
Open the Print dialog by choosing File - Print and select the fax driver in the Name combo box.  
Clicking OK opens the dialog of your fax driver where you can enter the fax recipient.  
Configuring %PRODUCTNAME for Faxing via Icon  
You can configure faxing from %PRODUCTNAME in such a way that a single click on one icon is sufficient to send a fax:  
Choose Tools - Options - Text Document - Print.  
Select the Fax combo box of your fax driver and close the dialog by clicking OK.  
Open the context menu on the function bar and click Visible Buttons.  
You see a list of immediately configurable buttons for this toolbar.  
All buttons that are currently visible have a mark.  
In the context menu, click to mark the Send Standard Fax button.  
The button is now visible on the function bar.  
By clicking on it the fax driver entered in step 2 is activated to send the current document.  
Changing Icon Views  
You can change the icon view between flat icons and 3D icons.  
Choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME.  
In the View register unmark Flat buttons.  
Click OK to confirm the new settings and close the dialog.  
The Flat buttons check box switches between flat and 3D view.  
The Large buttons check box switches between large and small icons.  
Using Floating Toolbars  
The Insert icon is at the top of the main toolbar of a text document.  
This opens a floating toolbar containing further icons.  
Either click the icon that you want to activate, or seize the floating toolbar by its title bar and drag it away from the main toolbar while holding down the mouse button (You first have to release the mouse button, otherwise you cannot seize the title bar with the mouse).  
Now look at the icon at the top of the main toolbar with which you opened the floating toolbar.  
You will see that the icon you used before is still there.  
If you now click the Insert Graphics icon, you will see that icon at the top of the main toolbar instead.  
A short click opens the directly visible function, whereas a longer click opens the floating toolbar again.  
Toolbars with text documents  
Inserting and Editing Buttons  
Open the Form Functions floating toolbar.  
Click the Push Button icon from the Form Functions floating toolbar.  
The pointer will change to a cross-hair symbol.  
In the document, drag open a box representing the size and position of the command button you want to insert.  
The new button is selected.  
To select a button, click on the edge, where the mouse pointer appears with a cross with four arrows, or keep the (Option) (Alt) key pressed.  
You can move and scale a selected button like a graphic.  
You can open dialogs for editing properties via the button's context menu.  
Select the Control command from the context menu of the selected button for accessing the Properties: Button  
You can also call this dialog by clicking the Control Properties icon contained in the Form Functions floating toolbar.

Use the Events tab if you would like to run a macro when the button has been clicked.  
Click the suspensive points button at the right to access a selection dialog for macros.  
Select a macro which has to run when the button is clicked and then confirm your selection by clicking the Assign button.  
You can use custom macros for this function.  
End the design mode using the icon on the Form Functions floating toolbar.  
If you now click on your button in the document (not on the edge), the assigned macro will run.  
In addition to the properties of the selected controls, you also can control the properties of the form to which the control belongs.  
Click the Form Function floating toolbar on the Form properties icon.  
Among other things, the form defines the database and table the form controls link to.  
You can link events with macros in forms with the Events tab.  
Doing this lets you run a specific macro when a form is loaded, for example.  
The other icons on the Form Functions floating toolbar serve to define interactive documents.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Basic you can also define your own dialogs - for this purpose, there are other controls for dialogs available to you in the %PRODUCTNAME Basic IDE.  
Inserting, Moving and Deleting Icons on Toolbars  
We will show you later how you to deal with all the functions possible in %PRODUCTNAME (including self-writing macros) to connect a function as an icon in a toolbar.  
Open a document of the type for which you want to modify the toolbar.  
If you want to modify the text object bar for all text documents, open a text document, and then do the same for the other document types.

You come to a free window.  
Drag the toolbar to its new position.  
If you release the mouse key while holding down the (Ctrl) key, and if the toolbar is also over a window border, the toolbar will dock with the window border.  
Tools - Configure  
Inserting Objects From the Gallery  
You can insert an object in a document either as a copy or as a link.  
A copy of an object is independent of the original object.  
Changes to the original object have no effect on the copy.  
Changes to the original object are also reflected in the link.  
Inserting an object as a copy  
Open the Gallery.  
Select a theme in the left area.  
Select the object by a single click.  
Drag the object into the document or right-click to open the context menu and select Insert and Copy.  
Inserting an object as a link  
Open the Gallery.  
Select a theme in the left area.  
Select the object by a single click.  
Drag the object into the document while pressing the (Shift) and (Ctrl) keys, or right-click to open the context menu and select Insert and Link.  
Inserting an object as a background graphic  
Open the Gallery.  
Select a theme in the left area.  
Select the object by a single click.  
Open the context menu and choose Insert - Background - Page or Paragraph.  
Inserting an object as a texture (pattern) for another object  
Open the Gallery.  
Select a theme in the left area.  
Select the object by a single click.  
Drag the object on to the other object in the document while pressing (Ctrl).  
Editing Hyperlinks  
Change the text of a hyperlink as follows  
Click on the hyperlink all the while keeping the (Option) (Alt) key pressed.  
Click on the HYP field on the status bar so that SEL appears in it.  
Move the cursor with the cursor keys to the hyperlink.  
You can now edit the text without activating the hyperlink.  
Change the URL of a hyperlink as follows  
As described above, move the cursor to the hyperlink and open Hyperlink Dialog (icon on the function bar).  
Open Hyperlink Bar (View - Toolbars - Hyperlink Bar).  
Click on the hyperlink, do not release the mouse button and drag the hyperlink to the hyperlink bar.  
The mouse pointer points to where you can drop the hyperlink.  
Edit the URL on the hyperlink bar and press the Return key.  
Change the attribute of all hyperlinks as follows  
Edit the color and formatting of hyperlinks in your document through the "Internet Link" und "Visited Internet Link" Character Styles in the Stylist.  
Edit a hyperlink button as follows  
If the hyperlink is a button, click on the border to select it, or press the (Option) (Alt) key while clicking.  
You can edit the label text under "Caption," and modify the address in the "URL" field.  
Switch off the automatic recognition of hyperlink as follows  
Switch the automatic recognition of hyperlinks on and off by choosing Tools - AutoCorrect/AutoFormat - Options in the URL Recognition check box.  
Inserting Hyperlinks  
You can insert hyperlinks in two ways: as text or a button.  
In both cases the visible text can be differentiated from a URL.  
Display the hyperlink bar by choosing View - Toolbars - Hyperlink Bar.  
Enter the visible text in the left field and the full URL in the right field, including http: / / or file: / /.  
Place the text cursor in the document at the point where the hyperlink should be inserted.  
Click the Link icon on the hyperlink bar or click Accept in the hyperlink dialog.  
The hyperlink is inserted as text.  
If you wish to insert the hyperlink as a button, keep the mouse button pressed on the Link icon a little longer and select the As Button command in the sub-menu or select the Button entry in the hyperlink dialog beside Form.  
If you would rather use the Hyperlink Dialog instead of the hyperlink bar to define the hyperlink, you can open it using the icon on the function bar.  
If you wish to jump to a specific position in the same text document, enter a bookmark at that position (Insert - Bookmark).  
If you wish to branch out to a cell in a table, enter a name for the cell (Insert - Name - Define).  
In the Collection Box for Internet URLs combo box enter only the short form of the URL when jumping within the same document:  
If the bookmark is called Target, enter Target.  
To jump to another document, enter the complete URL.  
By inputting C:\Docu\File1.sdw#Target, %PRODUCTNAME automatically inserts the correct way of writing - file:///c_BAR_/Doku/Datei1.sdw#Sprungziel.  
Hyperlinks can also be inserted by drag-and-drop from the Navigator.  
Hyperlinks can refer to references, headings, graphics, tables, objects, directories or bookmarks.  
If you wish to insert in a text a hyperlink that refers to Table 1, drag the entry Table 1 from the Navigator and drop it in the text.  
To do this, the Insert as Hyperlink drag mode must be selected in the Navigator.  
Relative and Absolute Links  
When you include hyperlinks, (at least) two factors must be taken into account, namely whether they are set as relative or absolute on saving, and whether or not the file is present:  
%PRODUCTNAME behaves differently depending on the setting entered under Tools - Options - Load/Save - General, where you can choose whether the links should be created in relative or absolute fashion on saving.  
Relative addressing is only possible when the output document and the destination of the link are on the same drive.  
You should create the same directory structure on your hard disk as that which exists in the web space hosted by your Internet provider.  
Call the root directory for the homepage on your hard disk "homepage", for example.  
The start file is then "index.htm", for example, the full path being "C:\homepage\index.htm".  
The URL on your Internet provider's server might, for example, then be as follows: "http://www.myprovider.com/mypage/index.htm".  
With relative addressing you indicate the link relative to the location of the output document.  
For example, if you placed all the graphics for your homepage in a subfolder called "C:\homepage\images", you would need to give the following path to access the graphic "picture.gif": "images\picture.gif".  
This is the relative path, starting from the location of the file "index.htm".  
When you transfer the document "index.htm" to the provider's server via the File - Save As dialog, and if you have marked the option Copy local graphics to Internet under Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility, %PRODUCTNAME will automatically copy the graphic to the correct directory on the server.  
An absolute path such as "C:\homepage\graphics\picture.gif" would no longer function on the provider server.  
Neither a server nor a computer of a reader needs to have a C: hard drive: (operating systems such as Unix or MacOS do not recognize drive letters) and even if the folder homepage\grahics existed your picture would not be available.  
It is better to use relative addressing for file links.  
A link to a web page, e.g., "www.stardivision.com" or "www.myprovider.com/mypage/index.htm" is an absolute link.  
%PRODUCTNAME also reacts differently, depending on whether the file referred to in the link exists, and where it is located. %PRODUCTNAME checks every new link and sets a target and protocol automatically.  
The result can be seen in the generated HTML code (not in the Help tip of the link, see note below) after saving the source document.  
The following rules apply:  
A relative reference ("graphic/picture.gif") is only possible when both files exist on the same drive.  
If the files are on different drives in your local file system, the absolute reference follows the "file:" protocol ("file:///data1/xyz/picture.gif").  
If the files are on different servers or if the target of the link is not available, the absolute reference uses the "http:" protocol ("http://data2/abc/picture.gif").  
Therefore, be sure to organize all files for your homepage on the same drive as the start file of the homepage.  
In this way, %PRODUCTNAME can set the protocol and target so that the reference on the server is always correct.  
When you rest your mouse on a hyperlink, a help tip displays the absolute reference, since %PRODUCTNAME uses absolute path names internally.  
The complete path and address can only be seen when you view the result of the HTML export, i.e., by loading the HTML file as "Text" or opening it with a text editor.  
Searching With the Hyperlink Bar  
The Search function in the Hyperlink bar is explained in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Enter the text you want to find in the URL Text field.  
If you double-click on a word in a text, it is automatically entered.  
Click the Search icon to open a submenu.  
Select your preferred search engine from the list.  
%PRODUCTNAME calls your Web Browser and the latter makes the connection to a search engine.  
After a short time you will see the result of your search on screen.

Inserting, Editing, Saving Bitmaps  
Inserting Bitmaps  
A bitmap image can be inserted in %PRODUCTNAME Writer, %PRODUCTNAME Calc, %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress documents.  
Choose Insert - Graphics - From File.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress choose Insert - Graphic.  
Select the file.  
With the File type field you can limit the selection to certain file types.  
Check the Link box if you want a link to the original file.  
If the Link box is marked, whenever the document is updated and loaded the bitmap image is reloaded, and the editing steps, that you have carried out in the local copy of the image in the document, are re-applied and the image is displayed.  
If the Link box is not checked, you are always working with the copy created with the first insertion.  
Click Open to insert the image.  
Editing Bitmaps  
When you select the bitmap image, the object bar offers you the tools for editing the image.  
Only a local copy is edited in the document, even if you have inserted an image as a link.  
The object bar may look slightly different depending to the module you are using.  
The illustration shows the object bar in %PRODUCTNAME Draw object bar in %PRODUCTNAME Draw object bar in %PRODUCTNAME Draw:  
A number of filters are located on the Filter floating toolbar, that you can open with the icon on the far left of the object bar:  
Some of the filters open once a dialog is started, and you can use these, for example, to select the intensity of the filter.  
You can provide the bitmap image with text and graphics, select these objects together and export the selection as a new bitmap image.  
Saving Bitmaps  
If you want to save the changes to a bitmap image as an image file, for example in the GIF, JPEG or TIFF file format, you must select and export the bitmap image.  
This is only possible in %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress.  
Select the bitmap image.  
Also select additional objects as necessary (with the shift key pressed or by opening a frame around all objects) if, for example, you want to provide the bitmap image with text.  
Choose File - Export.  
You see the Export dialog.  
GIF or JPEG.  
If you only want to export the selected objects, check the Selection box.  
If Selection is not checked, the entire page of the document is exported.  
Enter a name for the file and click Save.  
Drawing Graphics With the Draw Functions  
Open Show Draw Functions on the main toolbar.  
When you select a function, the relevant icon appears on the main toolbar.  
A longer click opens the floating toolbar from which you can select a different function.  
Draw objects can be edited and modified subsequently.  
Drawing elements created in this way are vector graphics which you can scale freely without any loss of quality.  
Drag the floating toolbar on to the screen as a separate window if you want to draw several elements.  
Create a rectangle by clicking the rectangle icon, then pointing in the document at the place where you want one corner of the rectangle to be.  
Press the mouse button there and hold it down while dragging to the opposite corner of the rectangle.  
When you release the mouse button, the rectangle is inserted in the document.  
It is selected, and you can edit its properties via the context menu.  
If you want to open up draw objects from the center instead of dragging from one corner to the other, hold down the (Option) (Alt) key while dragging.  
For example, instead of a rectangle with sides of different length, you obtain a square.  
To scale the objects, first select them by clicking on them with the selection tool.  
You then see eight handles around the object.  
When you drag one of the four corner handles, the opposite corner remains fixed while the other three corners move.  
When you drag one of the side handles, the opposite side remains fixed.  
To move draw objects, first select them (individually, or press Shift to select several together).  
Select text objects by clicking exactly on their edge.  
While holding down the mouse button, drag the objects to the new location.  
If you hold down Shift while dragging, the objects can only be positioned in places compatible with the page margins and the other objects on the page.  
Hold down the Command key (Ctrl) while dragging the draw object to copy the object.  
To revert to normal text mode after creating and editing draw objects, click in an area of the document containing no draw or other objects.  
If you are in a drawing view, first exit this by clicking the Select icon, for example.  
Information about the individual icons  
Inserting Special Characters  
This is how to insert special characters (such as check marks, boxes, telephone symbols etc.) in your text.  
To view a selection of all characters, choose Insert - Special Characters.  
In the large selection field click the desired character or several characters in succession.  
The characters are displayed at the bottom of the dialog.  
When you close the dialog with OK, all displayed characters in the selected font are inserted in the current document.  
In any text input field (e.g. in the URL field of the function bar or in the input fields in the Find&Replace dialog) you can press Shift+ Command Ctrl +S to call the Special Characters dialog.  
At present there are three ways of entering letters with accents directly from the keyboard.  
Sun Solaris:  
Using a Sun keyboard.  
First press the Compose key to the right of the space bar, then enter the first and second modifiers.  
Linux / NetBSD:  
Using the dead-keys.  
In an xterm window first press the 'or' key.  
It should not appear on the screen.  
Now press, for example, e.  
The e is given an accent é or è.  
If not, then check in the XF86Config file if a "nodeadkeys" XkbdVariant has been loaded there and replace it.  
You may also have set the environment-variable SAL_NO_DEADKEYS, that deactivates the dead-keys.  
All Unix systems: (Alt Gr) as additional compose key.  
The (Alt Gr) key can work in %PRODUCTNAME like the Compose key, if you set the environment variable SAL_ALTGR_COMPOSE.  
The Alt Gr key must trigger a mode_switch, so, for example, xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_R = Mode_switch" must be set.  
First press (Alt Gr), then the first modifier, then the second modifier.  
The characters are combined as described on a Solaris system in the file /usr/openwin/include/X11/Suncompose.h.  
Special Characters  
Modifying an Existing Installation  
You can modify an existing installation of %PRODUCTNAME by adding new components and removing installed ones.  
Start the Setup Program of %PRODUCTNAME either via the Windows start menu or either via the start bar or directly from the %PRODUCTNAME installation folder.  
{installdir}\program\setup.exe {installdir}/setup

Select the installation option Modify from the installation dialog and follow the instructions on the screen.  
In the dialogs that follow, you can select particular components for installation or deinstallation.  
Repairing a damaged installation  
If parts of %PRODUCTNAME no longer work correctly because of damaged program files or registry entries, you can repair a damaged installation using the setup program.  
Start the Setup Program of %PRODUCTNAME either via the Windows start menu or either via the start bar or directly from the %PRODUCTNAME installation folder.  
{installpath}\program\setup.exe {installpath}/setup  
{installdir} indicates the directory in which you have installed %PRODUCTNAME.  
Select Repair as the installation option from the installation dialog and follow the instructions on the screen.  
Printing Address Labels  
If you want to print address stickers, for form letters which do not fit in window envelopes, for example, this is how to do it:  
1.  
Choose File - New - Labels to open the Labels dialog.  
2.  
Select the format of the label sheets you want to print on.  
Remember to mark Synchronize contents on the Options tab.  
Click on New Document to close the dialog.  
3.  
When you see the label document, open the data source view by pressing the F4 key.  
Click the thumb tack icon at the edge of the data source view if it covers the first label.  
4.  
In the data source view, select your address data source table.  
5.  
Drag the data fields needed for the Address individually into the top left label.  
For example, click on the column header NAME and, keeping the mouse button depressed, drag it into the label.  
This inserts a field.  
Put the fields in order to complete the address in the first label at top left.  
6.  
Place the cursor at the last text position (after the last field) in the first label.  
7.  
Open the Fields dialog, for example by pressing the shortcut keys (Command) (Ctrl) (F2), and go to the Database tab.  
8.  
Select the type Next record, click on Insert and then on Close.  
9.  
You can now synchronize the labels.  
Click on the Synchronize button in the small window.  
10.  
In the data source view, select the records for which you would like address stickers, by clicking on the row headers to the left.  
Use the Shift or Command Ctrl key in the usual way to select several records at the same time.  
11.  
On the database bar, click the Data in Fields icon.  
12.  
You can then save and/or print the label document.  
After the last label on the page, the command Next Record is effected automatically.  
Therefore, do not insert the command manually after the last label on a page.  
Printing Labels With Serial Numbers  
If, for example, you want to print lottery tickets or entry tickets with serial numbers on them, this is how to do it:  
Choose File - New - Labels.  
This opens the Labels dialog.  
On the Labels tab, under Format, select the format in which you want to print.  
These label tags or rolls, available from specialist suppliers, are often made from stiff paper with tear-off perforations, or they are self-adhesive labels on a backing material.  
If you want to define the format yourself, select the Format tab.  
On the Options tab, mark Synchronize contents.  
Click on New Document.  
A new document is now created, divided up in the way you want.  
You only have to edit the top left label, then press Synchronize labels to make all labels appear the same.  
The button is only visible if you previously marked Synchronize contents on the Options tab.  
Enter your text in the top left label and format the font the way you want it.  
You can include serial numbering by inserting a field.  
Place the cursor at the point where the number should appear.  
Press (Command) (Ctrl) (F2) or choose Insert - Fields - Other.  
In the Fields dialog, go to the Variables tab.  
Select the type Set variable, if it is not already marked.  
In the Name box, enter a name of your choice for the counting variable, for example Number.  
To increment the variable from one label to the next by 1, enter the following formula in the Value text box:  
Number+1.  
Click Insert, then close the Fields dialog.  
Click Synchronize Labels.  
Now you can save and print the finished document.  
Creating and Printing Labels and Business Cards  
Designing Business Cards via Dialog  
Choose File - New - Business Cards to open a dialog with several tabs which allow you to choose how your business cards will look.  
Designing Labels and Business Cards  
There is yet another way of designing business cards - if you regard business cards as a simplified, special kind of label.  
In general, all business cards are the same.  
Labels can be filled with different contents obtained from a database, or they can be marked with serial numbers.  
Choose File - New - Labels to open the Labels dialog.  
On the Labels tab, under Format, define the label format.  
%PRODUCTNAME Writer contains many formats of commercially available sheets for labels, badges, business cards etc.  
You can add other, user-defined formats.  
On the Labels tab, under Inscription, you can choose what you want written on the labels.  
This often involves database fields, so that the labels can be printed with varying content, when sending "Form Letters" for example.  
But it is equally possible to have the same text printed on every label.  
Use the combo boxes to select the database and table from which the data fields are obtained.  
Click on the big arrow to transfer the selected data field into the inscription area.  
You can also enter spaces and any other fixed text.  
On the Format tab you can define your own label formats, not covered by the predefined formats.  
To be able to do this, the label type on the Labels tab must be set to "User-defined".  
On the Options tab, you can specify whether all labels or only certain ones are to be created.  
On the Options tab page, make sure that the Synchronize contents check box is marked.  
If this is marked, an identically repeated label only has to be entered (on the top left label) and edited once.  
As soon as you click on New Document, you will see a small window with the Synchronize Labels button.  
Enter the first label.  
When you click on the Synchronize Labels button, the current individual label is copied to all the other labels on the sheet.  
Click on New Document to create a new document with the settings you have entered.  
Print the new document.  
Business Cards  
Selecting the Document Language  
The language you select for your document specifies, amongst other things, the dictionary to be used for spellcheck, thesaurus and hyphenation, the decimal and thousands separator to be used and the default currency format.  
Basically, the language selected for the whole document applies.  
Within the document, you can apply a separate language to any Paragraph Style.  
This has priority over the language of the whole document.  
Within a paragraph, you can assign a language to selected pieces of text, either by direct formatting or via a Character Style.  
This assignment then has priority over the Paragraph Style and document language.  
Selecting a language for the whole document  
Go to Language Settings - Languages.  
Under Default languages for documents, select the document language for all documents created from new.  
If you mark For the current document only, your choice will only apply to the current document.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
Selecting a language for a Paragraph Style  
Place the cursor in the paragraph whose Paragraph Style you want to edit.  
Open the context menu and select Edit Paragraph Style....

Open the Stylist and click on the Character Styles icon.  
Click on the name of the Character Style to which you want to apply a different language.  
Then open the context menu in the Stylist and select Modify.  
This opens the Character Style dialog.  
Select the Font tab.  
Select the Language and click OK.  
Now you can apply the Character Style to your selected text.

Navigation to Quickly Reach Objects  
This is the most practical use of the Navigator.  
Double-click an object in the Navigator to jump directly to the position of the object in the document.  
You can use the Navigation floating toolbar to scroll to the previous or next object of a specific category.  
Open the floating toolbar using the Navigation icon below to the right of the document window or on top to the left in Navigator.  
On the Navigation floating toolbar you first select the category then click on one of the buttons to the right - Previous Object or Next Object.  
The names of the buttons refer to the category, for example, the button for scrolling is named depending on the "Next Page" or "Next Bookmark" category.  
Navigator for Overview of Documents  
For simplicity's sake, all contents of the Navigator window are referred to here as "categories," whether titles, sheets, tables, text frames, graphics, OLE objects, sections, hyperlinks, references, indexes or notes.  
The Navigator displays all types of object contained in a document.  
If a plus sign appears next to a category, this indicates that at least one object of this kind exists.  
If you rest the mouse pointer on the category name for a moment, the number of objects is displayed in an extended tip.  
Open an entry by clicking on the plus sign.  
If you only want to view the entries in a certain category, select the category and click the Toggle Content View icon.  
Until you click the icon again, only the objects of this category will be displayed.  
If the window of the docked Navigator is too small, turn it into a free window (double click on the gray area with the (command) (Ctrl) key pressed).  
You can then freely change the size.  
Showing Navigation Pane of the Help  
In the Help window, you can show or hide the navigation pane as needed.  
On the toolbar of the Help window, click the left icon to show or hide the navigation pane.  
Turning off Numbering/Bullets for Individual Paragraphs  
If the cursor is located in a numbering or bullet style then you can switch the automatic numbering or listing in the current paragraph or selected paragraphs off by clicking the Numbering Off icon in the numbering object bar or the Bullets On/Off icon in the text object bar.  
If the cursor is located within a section with numbering or bullets, you can turn off automatic numbers or bullets for the current paragraph or selected paragraphs by clicking the Number List On/Off icon on the Object Bar.  
To remove an existing paragraph from the numbering in a section of bullets or numbering using the keyboard, do the following:  
Place the cursor at the beginning of a numbered paragraph and press the Backspace key.  
Numbering resumes in the following paragraph.  
If you press the Enter key in an empty paragraph, the current numbering comes to an end.  
Format - Bullets/Numbering  
Selecting Maximum Possible Page Formats  
Not all printers can print a paper up to its edges.  
How far can you extend the text or graphics in a document before they get cut off?  
%PRODUCTNAME offers a semi-automatic feature that enables you to print as close to the paper's edge as it is possible.  
Make sure that your printer has been setup under File - Printer Setup.  
Make sure that the Online Layout in the View menu is not active.  
Select the Format - Page command, and go to the Page tab.  
Under Margins you can define the maximum or minimum possible value for the page margins (left, right, top, and bottom) by pressing the (Page Up) or (Page Down) keys.  
The preview displays a dashed line around the printable range.  
Click OK to close the dialog.

Protected Contents in %PRODUCTNAME  
Following is an overview of the different ways of protecting contents in %PRODUCTNAME from being modified, deleted or viewed.  
Protecting All Documents When Saving  
All documents that are saved in XML format (%PRODUCTNAME 6.0 Format) can be provided with a password.  
These documents can no longer be opened without the password.  
The content is secured, so that it cannot be read with an external editor either.  
This applies to content, graphics and OLE objects.  
Turning on protection  
Choose File - Save As and mark Save with password.  
Save the document.  
Turning off protection  
Open the document, entering the correct password.  
Choose File - Save As and unmark Save with password.  
The information that you can enter under File - Properties and which includes the name of the author, date created, word and character counts etc., will not be encrypted.  
Protecting Revision Marking  
With every change made in %PRODUCTNAME Calc and %PRODUCTNAME Writer, the review function records who made the change.  
This function can be turned on with protection, so that it can only be turned off when the correct password is entered.  
Acceptance or rejection is not possible.  
Turning on protection  
Choose Edit - Changes - Protect Records.  
Enter and confirm a password of at least 5 characters.  
Turning off protection  
Choose Edit - Changes - Protect Records.  
Enter the correct password.  
Protecting Cell Ranges in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc you can protect whole spreadsheets and the document as a whole.  
In the process you can choose whether the cells are protected against accidental changes, whether the formulas can be viewed, whether the cells are visible and/or whether the cells can be printed.  
Protection can be provided by means of a password, but it does not have to be.  
If you have assigned a password, protection can only be removed once the correct password has been entered.  
Please note that the cell protection for cells with the Protected attribute is only effective when you protect the whole table.  
In the default condition, every cell has the Protected attribute.  
Therefore you will remove the attribute selectively for those cells where the user may make changes.  
You then protect the whole table and save the document.  
Turning on protection  
For cells:  
Select cell range.  
Choose Tools - Protect Document - Sheet.  
Choose Tools - Protect Document - Document.  
Enter and confirm a password of at least 5 characters.  
Turning off protection  
Choose Tools - Protect Document - Sheet.  
Choose Tools - Protect Document - Document.  
Where a password has been assigned, enter the correct password.  
Protecting Sections in %PRODUCTNAME Writer  
Any section of a %PRODUCTNAME Writer text document can be protected against changes with a password.  
Turning on protection  
Select the section.  
Choose Insert - Section - Section, then under Write protection mark the Protect and With password check boxes. (If the section already exists:  
Format - Sections.) Enter and confirm a password of at least 5 characters.  
Turning off protection  
Choose Format - Sections - Section and under Write protection unmark Protect.  
Enter the correct password.  
Protecting Cells in a %PRODUCTNAME Writer Table  
You can protect the contents of individual cells of a %PRODUCTNAME Writer text table from changes.  
Turning on protection  
Place the cursor in a cell or select cells.  
Choose Format - Cell - Protect.  
Turning off protection  
Place the cursor in the cell or select the cells.  
First, if necessary, choose Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids and mark Cursor in protected areas - Enable.  
Then choose Format - Cell - Unprotect.  
Select the table in the Navigator, open the context menu and select Table - Unprotect.  
Use Shift+Ctrl+T to remove protection for the entire current table or all selected tables.  
Automatic Protection of Indexes and Tables  
Tables of contents, alphabetical indexes and so on created automatically in an %PRODUCTNAME Writer text are automatically protected against accidental changes.  
Turning on protection  
Place the cursor in the index/table of contents.  
From the context menu choose Edit Index/Table.  
On the Index/Table tab page, mark Protected against manual changes.  
Turning off protection  
Place the cursor in the index.  
First of all, if necessary, under Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids, mark Cursor in protected areas - Enable.  
From the context menu choose Edit Index/Table.  
On the Index/Table tab page, unmark Protected against manual changes.  
In the Navigator, select the index, then open the context menu and select Index - Read-only.  
Protecting frames, graphics and OLE objects  
Many objects can be inserted in %PRODUCTNAME documents.  
You can protect the content, position and/or size of inserted graphics.  
The same applies to frames (in Writer) and OLE objects.  
Turning on protection  
Choose Format - Graphics - Options tab.  
Under Protect, mark Contents, Position and/or Size.  
Turning off protection  
Choose Format - Graphics - Options tab.  
Protecting Drawing Objects and Form Objects  
The draw objects that you insert in your documents with the Draw Functions floating toolbar can be protected from being accidentally moved or changed in size.  
You can do the same with form objects inserted with the Form Functions floating toolbar.  
Turning on protection  
Choose Format - Position and Size - Position or Size tab.  
Mark the Protect check box.  
Turning off protection  
Choose Format - Position and Size - Position or Size tab.  
Unmark the Protect check box.  
Protect access to servers via WebDAV and FTP  
%PRODUCTNAME Quickstarter under Windows  
There are several ways to activate the %PRODUCTNAME Quickstarter under Windows:  
Mark the Load %PRODUCTNAME at system start-up check box in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Memory.  
Activate it without restarting the system:  
Start the programm quickstart.exe in the directory {installpath}\program.  
Use the Quickstarter icon  
Right-clicking the icon on the task bar opens a submenu where you can open a new, blank document, open the Templates and Documents dialog or the Open File dialog.  
Double-click the icon to open the Templates and Documents dialog.  
The Load %PRODUCTNAME at system start-up command can be enabled (with tick) or disabled (without tick).  
If the command has a tick against it and you click on it, the link to quickstart.exe will be removed from the Windows automatic start-up group.  
If there is no tick against the command and you click on it, an appropriate link will be copied to the automatic start-up group.  
The Exit Quickstarter command removes the icon from the system tray and all %PRODUCTNAME program routines from the main memory, provided all %PRODUCTNAME documents were closed beforehand.  
Removing %PRODUCTNAME from the memory  
Close all %PRODUCTNAME documents opened by, for example, choosing File - End.  
Open the context menu of the icon in the system tray.  
Choose Exit Quickstarter.  
%PRODUCTNAME has now been removed from the working memory.  
Accepting or Rejecting Changes  
When you bring your document in which others have noted their changes back together again, you can accept or reject the changes individually or all together.  
If you have put multiple copies of the document in circulation, first of all you merge these into one document (see).  
Open the document and choose Edit - Changes - Accept or Reject.  
The Accept or Reject Changes dialog appears.  
Select a change on the List tab.  
The change is selected and displayed in the document and you can now make your decision with one of the dialog buttons.  
If one author has changed another author's change, you will see the changes hierarchically arranged with a plus sign for opening up the hierarchy.  
If the list of changes is too long, you can switch to the Filter tab in the dialog and specify that you only want to see the changes of certain authors, or only the changes of the last day, or that you want the list to be restricted in some other way.  
You can also filter them by the descriptions.  
Wildcards (as with regular expressions in the Find & Replace dialog) are permitted when entering the filter.  
Text document changes that have not yet been accepted are displayed in the list.  
Changes that have been accepted are removed from the list and appear in the text without any further marking.  
Spreadsheet changes that have been accepted are combined in the list in a single entry, so that you can continue to see which changes have already been accepted.  
Color-coded entries inform you about the result of the filter that is set.  
Entries in black can be accepted or rejected and match the filter criteria.  
Entries in blue do not themselves match the filter criteria, but have subentries that are included by the filter.  
Green entries do match the filter but in spite of this cannot be accepted or rejected.  
Comparing Versions of a Document  
Perhaps one of the authors who received a copy of your document made changes but did not record them by choosing Edit - Changes - Record.  
You can compare the delivered copy of the document with your original document.  
Open your original document and then choose Edit - Compare Document.  
Confirm the dialog.  
Now %PRODUCTNAME combines both documents in your original document.  
All text passages that occur in your document but not in the copy are identified as having been inserted, and all text passages that are missing in your original document are identified as deletions.  
You can now accept the "insertions", in which case the relevant texts stay in their original form, or you can accept the "deletions", in which case the marked text contained in the copy are not inserted in your document.  
Merging Versions  
It is not always one and the same document that is edited by different authors and passed from one to the next author.  
It often makes more sense to give a separate copy of the document to each author.  
In our example, this means you'll receive three copies back in addition to the original document, with different changes in each copy.  
It is easy to merge these documents into your original.  
The only requirement is that the documents differ only and exclusively in the recorded changes - all "normal" text must be identical.  
Open your original document in which you want to merge all the copies.  
Choose Edit - Changes - Merge Document....  
You'll see a typical file selection dialog in which to select a copy of the document.  
After you merge the documents you will see the designated changes from the copy in the original document.  
Recording Changes  
The review function is available in %PRODUCTNAME for text documents and spreadsheet documents.  
Not all changes are recorded (for example, the changing of a tab stop from align left to align right is not recorded).  
However, all usual changes made by a proofreader are recorded, such as additions, deletions, text alterations, usual formatting etc.  
1.  
To start Revision Marking, open the document to be edited and choose Edit - Changes and put a check mark in front of Record.  
2.  
Now start making your changes.  
You will note that all new text passages you enter are underlined in color, while all text that you delete remains visible but is crossed out and shown in color.  
3.  
If you move to a marked change with the mouse pointer, you will see a reference to the type of change, the author, date and time of day for the change in the Help Tip.  
If the Extended Tips are also enabled (on the Help menu), you will also see any available comments on this change.  
Changes in a spreadsheet document are highlighted by a border around the cells; when you point to the cell you can see more detailed information on this change in the Help Tips.  
You can enter a comment on each marked change by placing the cursor in the area of the change and then choosing Edit - Changes - Comment....  
In addition to Extended Tips, the comment is also displayed in the list in the Accept or Reject Changes dialog.  
To stop recording changes, choose Edit - Changes - Record again.  
The check mark is removed and you can now save the document and return it to the person who asked for the changes.  
This can be in the form of a red line in the margin, for example.  
You can select the type of additional selection under Tools - Options... - Text Document on the Changes tab or under Tools - Options - Spreadsheet on the Changes tab.  
Here you can determine how and in what color the changes should be flagged, where on the page the dash should be and so forth.  
Protecting Records  
You can record the changes made in a document by choosing Edit - Changes - Record or Edit - Changes - Protect Records.  
If you select Protect Records, you must enter the correct password in order to turn off the function or accept or reject changes.  
Choose Protect Records.  
This opens the Password dialog.  
Enter a password consisting of at least 5 characters and confirm it.  
Click OK.  
Version Management  
The File menu contains a Versions command.  
The Versions function allows you to save multiple versions of the same document in the same file.  
You can choose to view individual versions of a document, or you can display the differences between versions with color markings.  
In the dialog to open a document, you can select from a list box which version of this document you want to open.  
Recording and Displaying Changes  
When several authors are working on the same text or spreadsheet, the review function (marking changes, redlining) makes it possible to document who made which changes, so that this is clear to everyone.  
On the final edit of the document, it is then possible to look at each individual change and decide whether it should be accepted or rejected.  
Imagine you are an editor and are delivering your latest report.  
But before publication the report must be read by the senior editor and the proofreader, and both will add their changes.  
Perhaps the senior editor writes "clarify" after one paragraph and crosses out another entirely.  
The proofreader checks the spelling of your document and notes two cases where explicit references to the gender of an imaginary person could be reworded to avoid gender entirely.  
The edited document comes back to you, and you can incorporate or ignore the suggestions of the two reviewers.  
You asked for a few suggestions, and the document is now returned by e-mail with your colleague's suggestions.  
As all your colleagues and the managers in your company work with %PRODUCTNAME, it is a simple matter to produce a final version of the document from the results you get back.  
Creating Round Corners  
When you insert a rectangle or a callout box using the drawing tools and activate the function Edit Points, you see a small frame at the upper left corner of the object.  
The frame indicates the amount by which the corners are rounded.  
When the frame is positioned on the handle in the middle at the top of the object, the corners are rounded as much as possible.  
You adjust the degree of rounding by moving the frame between these two positions.  
If you place the cursor on the box it changes to a hand symbol.  
You can now drag the box to change the amount of rounding.  
An outline shows a preview of the result as you go.  
Sending Form Faxes  
If you wish to send a form fax to several fax recipients, there are two alternatives:  
Either your fax driver allows the entry of several recipients for the same document,  
or you wish to send a document with several individual data to each recipient according to a form letter.  
Additional information on form letters can be found in %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Note, however, that the fax driver must perform the individual assignment of a document to a fax number.  
For this purpose, you normally have to enter a sequence of control characters and the desired fax number in the first line of the document; please consult the please documentation of your fax software for help.  
Inserting Protected Spaces, Hyphens and Conditional Separators  
Non-breaking spaces  
To prevent two words from being separated at the end of a line, press the (Command) key (Ctrl) key when you type a space between the words.  
This is important, for example, between a title and the person's name.  
Non-breaking dash  
An example of a non-breaking dash would be in a company name such as A-Z.  
Obviously you would not want A- to appear at the end of a line and Z at the beginning of the next line.  
In other words, hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and press the minus key.  
Hyphen, dash  
In order to enter longer dashes, you can find under Tools - AutoCorrect /AutoFormat - Options the Replace dashes option.  
This option replaces one or two minus signs under certain circumstances with a long dash(see %PRODUCTNAME Help).  
For additional replacements see the replacements table under Tools - AutoCorrect /AutoFormat - Replace.  
Here you can, among other things, have a shortcut that you have defined automatically replaced when input by an optional dash, even in another font.  
Definite separator  
To support automatic hyphenation by entering a separator inside a word yourself, use the command Ctrl + minus sign.  
The word is separated at the end of the line at this position even if automatic hyphenation for this paragraph is switched off.  
Special characters  
Setting up Printer, Fax and Fonts under Unix  
Under Unix, the printer administration program "spadmin" is provided to help you set up printers, faxes and fonts for use with %PRODUCTNAME.  
Call the printer administration program "spadmin" as follows:  
Go to the {installpath}/program directory.  
Enter:  
./spadmin  
That is where you can make all important settings.  
During a network installation, the System Administrator first logs on as user root and calls the printer administration program "spadmin".  
He or she then creates a general printer configuration file called {installpath}/share/psprint/psprint.conf for all users.  
All changes are immediately available to all users in %PRODUCTNAME.  
The system administrator can also add fonts for all users in the network installation.  
However, these fonts are available only after restarting %PRODUCTNAME.  
Setting up Printers  
Under Unix, %PRODUCTNAME only offers direct support for PostScript printers.  
Other printers must be set up as described in the section Printer Drivers in %PRODUCTNAME. %PRODUCTNAME automatically provides a printer with the default driver for each system queue.  
You can add additional printers as needed.  
Adding a Printer  
Click the New Printer button.  
Select the Create Printer option and click Next.  
Select the appropriate driver for your printer.  
If you are not using a PostScript printer or your model is not listed, use the "Generic Printer" driver or follow the steps below.  
You can also add new drivers using the Import button or delete unnecessary drivers using the Delete button (see below for details).  
Click Next.  
Choose a command line that you can use to print on your printer (for example, lp -d my_queue).  
Click Next.  
Give the printer a name and determine whether it should become the default printer.  
Click Finish.  
To print a test page, click on Test Page.  
If the test page fails to print or is incorrectly printed, check all settings as described in Change Printer Settings.  
You now have a new printer in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Printer Drivers in %PRODUCTNAME  
When installing a non-PostScript enabled printer, you must set your system so that PostScript can be converted into the language of the printer.  
We recommend using current PostScript conversion software such as Ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost /).  
You should set up the "Generic Printer" in that case.  
Make sure the page margins are set correctly as well.  
You can find this information in the following sections.  
If you are in possession of a PostScript-enabled printer, you must always install a description file that adapts the printer (PostScript Printer Definition - PPD) so that you can utilize the paper tray selection, the duplex print function (if the printer has it) and any built-in fonts.  
You can also use the generic printer driver since it contains the most important data and is suitable for most printers.  
In that case, you will have to do without the paper tray selection and correctly set the page margins.  
Some PPD files are installed as default files.  
If there is no matching PPD file for your printer, you will find various PPD files at http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers /.  
You can also ask the manufacturer of your printer for PPD files.  
Unpack a suitable driver and connect it with spadmin to your system.  
This is what you do:  
Drivers can be imported or deleted when creating a new printer.  
To import new drivers, click Import in the driver selection dialog.  
Click Browse to select the directory where you unpacked the PPD files.  
In the Selection of drivers list box, select the printer driver you want to install and then click OK.  
To delete a printer driver, select the printer driver and click Delete.  
Be sure that you do not delete the generic printer driver, and remember that drivers deleted from network installations are no longer available to other users who are using the same network installation.  
If the printer has more fonts built in than the usual PostScript fonts, you must also load the AFM files for these additional fonts.  
Copy the AFM files into the {installpath}/share/psprint/fontmetric directory of the %PRODUCTNAME installation or into the {installpath}/user/psprint/fontmetric directory of the User Installation.  
You can find AFM files, for example, at ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/afmfiles /.  
Changing Printer Settings  
In the printer administration program "spadmin", select the printer from the Installed printers list box and click Properties.  
The Properties dialog appears containing several tab pages.  
This is where you can make settings that are used according to the PPD file of the selected printer.  
Select the command on the Command tab page.  
You can remove superfluous commands using the Remove button.  
On the Paper tab page, you can define the paper format and paper tray to be used as the default settings for this printer.  
On the Device tab page, you can activate the special options for your printer.  
If your printer can only print in black and white, choose "grayscale" under Color, otherwise choose "color".  
If switching to grayscale leads to unfavorable results, you can also select "color" under Color and see how the printer or PostScript emulator applies it.  
Furthermore, on this tab page you can set the precision with which colors are described as well as the PostScript level.  
The Font Replacement tab page allows you to select a printer font type available in the printer for each font type installed on your computer.  
This way you can reduce the data volume sent to the printer.  
Font replacement can be turned on or off for each printer individually.  
You should also set the page margins correctly on the Additional settings tab when using the generic printer drivers so that your printout is not cropped.  
You can also enter a description in the Comments field, which will also be displayed on the Print dialog.  
Some of these settings can also be set per document/printout in the Print dialog or the Printer Settings dialog in %PRODUCTNAME via the Properties button.  
Renaming or Deleting Printers  
Select a printer from the Installed printers list box.  
To rename the selected printer, click Rename.  
Enter an appropriate name in the dialog that appears and click OK.  
The name must be unique and should be chosen so that you can recognize the printer and the application.  
Printer names must be assigned the same for all users because, when documents are exchanged, the selected printer remains unchanged if the recipient has it under the same name.  
To delete the selected printer, click Remove.  
The default printer or a printer that has been created by the system administrator in a network installation cannot be removed using this dialog.  
Selecting a Default Printer  
To make the printer selected from the Installed printers list box the default printer, double-click its name or click the Default button.  
Using Fax Functionality  
If you have already installed a fax package such as Efax or HylaFax on your computer, you can send faxes with %PRODUCTNAME.  
Click New Printer.  
This opens the Add Printer dialog.  
Select Connect a fax device.  
Click Next.  
Choose whether to use the default driver or another printer driver.  
Click Next.  
If you are not using the default driver, select the appropriate driver and click Next.  
Enter a command line with which to communicate with the fax in the following dialog.  
In the command line of each fax sent "(TMP)" is replaced by a temporary file and "(PHONE)" by the telephone number of the recipient fax machine.  
If "(TMP)" occurs in the command line, the PostScript code is transmitted in a file, otherwise via standard input (i.e., as a pipe).  
Click Next.  
Assign a name to your new fax printer and determine whether the telephone numbers (see below) marked in the text should be removed from the printout, or not.  
Click Finish.  
You can now send faxes by printing to the printer that has just been created.  
Enter the fax number as text in the document.  
You can also enter a field that takes the fax number from your active database.  
In any case, the fax number must start with the characters @@# and end with @@.  
A valid entry would have the form @@#1234567@@.  
If these characters including the telephone number are not printed, activate the Fax number is removed from the printout option under Properties on the Command tab page.  
If no telephone number is entered in the document, a dialog prompting you for it will appear after the printout.  
In %PRODUCTNAME you can also activate a button for sending faxes to a default fax.  
To do this, right-click the function bar, open the Visible Buttons submenu and click the Send Default Fax button.  
You can set which fax is used when this button is pressed under Tools - Options - Text Document - Print.  
Remember to create one separate print job for each fax, otherwise, the first recipient would receive all the faxes.  
In the File - Form Letter dialog select the Printer option and then the Create Individual Print Jobs field.  
Connecting a PostScript for PDF Converter  
If a PostScript for PDF converter such as Ghostscript or Adobe Acrobat Distiller(tm) is installed on your computer, you can quickly create PDF documents in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Click New Printer.  
This opens the Add Printer dialog.  
Select Connect a PDF converter.  
Click Next.  
Choose whether to use the default driver, the Acrobat Distiller driver or another driver.  
Click Next.  
If you are not using the default driver or the Acrobat Distiller driver, select the appropriate driver and click Next.  
In the next dialog, enter a command line with which to communicate with the PostScript->PDF Converter.  
Moreover, enter the directory where the PDF files created should be saved.  
If you do not provide this directory, the user's home directory will be used.  
In the command line of each created PDF document "(TMP)" is replaced by a temporary file and "(OUTFILE)" by the target file, the name of which is created from the document name.  
If "(TMP)" occurs in the command line, the Postscript code is transmitted in a file, otherwise via standard input (i.e., as a pipe).  
If Ghostscript or Adobe Acrobat Distiller is in the search path, you can use one of the predefined command lines.  
Click Next.  
Assign a name to your new PDF converter.  
Click Finish.  
You can now create PDF documents by printing to the converter that has just been created.  
Installing Fonts  
When you are working with %PRODUCTNAME you might notice that a different number of fonts is provided depending on the document type being used.  
This is because not all of the fonts can be used in every case.  
Therefore, only those fonts will be shown in the font selection box when working with a text document which can also be printed, as it is assumed that you will only want to use those fonts that you can actually have printed on paper.  
In an HTML document or in online layout, only fonts that are available on screen are offered.  
On the other hand, when working with spreadsheets and drawings you will be able to use all of the fonts that can be either printed or shown on the screen.  
%PRODUCTNAME tries to have the display on screen correspond to the printout (WYSIWYG).  
Possible problems using the font are shown in the bottom margin of the dialog you open by choosing Format - Character.  
Adding Fonts  
You can integrate additional fonts in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Fonts which you integrate are available exclusively to %PRODUCTNAME and can be used with various Xservers without your having to install them there.  
To make the fonts available to other programs as well, proceed as usual by adding the fonts to your Xserver. %PRODUCTNAME can display and print out PostScript Type1 fonts as well as TrueType fonts (including TrueType Collections).  
To integrate additional fonts in %PRODUCTNAME, proceed as follows:  
Start spadmin.  
Click Fonts.  
All fonts added for %PRODUCTNAME are listed in the dialog that appears.  
You can remove selected fonts using the Remove button or add new fonts with the Add button.  
Click Add.  
The Add Fonts dialog appears.  
Enter the directory from which you want to add the fonts.  
Press the... button and select the directory from the path selection dialog or enter the directory directly.  
Now a list of the fonts from this directory appears.  
Select the fonts you want to add.  
To add all the fonts, click Select All.  
With the Create soft links only check box you can determine whether the fonts are to be copied into the %PRODUCTNAME directory or only symbolic links are to be created there.  
If the fonts to be added are on a data medium that is not always available (such as a CD-ROM), you must copy the fonts.  
Click OK.  
The fonts will now be added.  
In the case of a network installation, the fonts are installed in that installation if possible.  
If the user has no write access rights, the fonts will be installed in the user installation so that only the user who installed them can access them.  
Deleting Fonts  
To delete fonts, proceed as follows:  
Start spadmin.  
Click Fonts.  
All fonts added to %PRODUCTNAME are listed in the dialog that now appears.  
Select the fonts you want to delete and click Delete.  
You can delete only the fonts that have been added for %PRODUCTNAME.  
Renaming Fonts  
You can also rename fonts added for %PRODUCTNAME.  
This is especially useful for fonts that contain several localized names (such as an English and a Japanese name).  
You can replace this with a suitable name.  
Start spadmin.  
Click Fonts.  
Select the fonts you want to rename and click Rename.  
Enter a new name in the dialog that appears.  
If the font contains several names, these names will serve as suggestions in the combo box where you enter the new name.  
Click OK.  
If you select several fonts to rename, one dialog appears for each selected font.  
If you have selected a TrueType Collection (TTC), one dialog appears for each of the fonts contained in it.  
Changing Default Templates  
When you open a new document with File - New a blank document appears based on a %PRODUCTNAME template.  
You can edit or modify this document or replace it with an existing document so that the new document contains your customized format attributes or other contents.  
Modifying Default Templates  
First, open a new, empty document and edit it until you feel it would make a good template.  
For example, edit the Styles in the Stylist.  
If you have already found a %PRODUCTNAME document which satisfies your needs, this step is not necessary.  
You can define a template for each %PRODUCTNAME module.  
The following describes how to proceed for text documents.  
1.  
Now save the document by choosing File - Templates - Save and saving the document in, for example, the Default category.  
2.  
Choose File - Templates - Organize.  
3.  
Double-click Default in the list on the left.  
You will see the user-defined templates in the directory {installpath}\user\template.  
Select the template you have just saved and open the context menu or open the submenu of the Commands button.  
4.  
Choose Set as default template.  
That is all you have to do.  
The next time you open a new text document, the new document will correspond to the template you selected.  
Resetting Default Templates  
To reset the modified text template to the original default template, proceed as follows:  
Choose File - Templates - Organize.  
Open the context menu and choose Reset default template.  
In the submenu, select the document type whose default setting you want to restore.  
Thereafter, when you open an empty text document, it will again correspond to the %PRODUCTNAME default template for text documents.  
Using Custom Templates  
There are several ways to make your work easier by using your own custom templates.  
One of the most important is quick access to the templates.  
Opening a new document with one of your templates will then differ accordingly.  
Templates in the Template Folder  
You can save a new template via File - Templates - Save or select the "Template" file type in the "normal" Save dialog.  
If you save the template in the {installpath}/user/template directory, you can access this template anytime by selecting it in the New dialog (File - New - From Templates and Documents).  
When you open the template, a new document will be created based on that template.  
You may need to update the view of the templates in the dialog before you can see a newly created template.  
In this case, choose File - Templates - Organize and in the submenu of the Commands button, choose Update.  
To modify the template yourself, you can call this file via File - Templates - Edit and then edit it.  
Templates  
Moving, Deleting or Copying Icons  
To move an icon keep the Option key (Alt) key pressed and drag the icon to its new position.  
It will be moved within the same toolbar and copied between toolbars.  
To delete an icon from a toolbar, keep the Option key (Alt) key pressed and drag the icon to a place where there is no toolbar.  
To insert or delete a dash, drag the icon in the same way to the side.  
Switching Object Bars With the Context Menu  
If the cursor, for example, is pointed toward a text table, the icon for editing the table is automatically prepared.  
If the cursor points to a bullet, you will see an object bar with icons that are appropriate for bullets.  
If the cursor is in a bullet within a table, you can switch between the possible object bars as follows:  
Click on the last icon on the right side of the object bar.  
Or open the context menu of the object bar.  
You will see a list of the possible object bars where you can click on the desired toolbar.  
%PRODUCTNAME remembers which object bar you chose in the respective context and shows this first the next time.  
Merging and Splitting Cells  
You can select adjacent cells together, then merge them into a single cell.  
Conversely, you can take a large cell that has been created by merging single cells, and divide it back into individual cells.  
The commands are different in %PRODUCTNAME Writer and Calc.  
Merging Cells in %PRODUCTNAME Writer  
Select the adjacent cells.  
Choose Format - Cell - Merge.  
Splitting Cells in %PRODUCTNAME Writer  
Place the cursor in the cell to be split.  
Choose Format - Cell - Split.  
A dialog allows you to split the cell into two or more cells, horizontally or vertically.

To move several tab stops on the ruler, press the Shift key before you click a tab.  
Drag one tab while continuing to press Shift to move that tab as well as all the tabs to the right of it.  
The spacing between those tabs remains the same.  
Press Command Ctrl instead of Shift when you drag a tab on the ruler to move that tab and all the tabs to the right of it.  
This results in the spacing between those tabs changing proportionally to their distance from the margin.  
Changing the Properties of Tabs  
To change tab type, click the tab you want to change on the ruler, then open the context menu.  
Deleting Tabs  
Simply hold down the mouse button while you drag the tab outside the ruler.

The various functions provided allow you to edit the points of a curve or an object converted to a curve.  
The following icons are available:  
Edit Points  
The Edit Points icon allows you to activate or deactivate the edit mode for Bézier objects.  
In the edit mode, individual points of the drawing object can be selected.  
Edit Points  
Move Points  
Click this icon to activate a mode in which you can move points.  
The mouse pointer displays a small empty square when resting on a point.  
Drag that point to another location.  
The curve on both sides of the point follows the movement; the section of the curve between the next points changes shape.  
Point at the curve between two points or within a closed curve and drag the mouse to shift the entire curve without distorting the form.  
Move Points  
Insert Points  
This mode allows you to insert points.  
You can also move points as in the move mode:  
If, however, you click at the curve between two points and move the mouse a little while holding down the mouse button you insert a new point.  
The point is a smooth one, the lines to the control points are parallel and remain so when moved.  
If you wish to create a corner point you must first insert either a smooth or a symmetrical point which is then converted to a corner point by using Set Corner Point.  
You can also insert points outside of the existing curve.  
By clicking next to the curve in the insert mode, the program automatically determines between which two points the new one is to be inserted based on spacing.  
If an exact position can be determined, the new point is inserted and the curve adjusted.  
To create a new curve not directly connected to the existing curve, press Command Ctrl when clicking.  
This curve, however, is seen as a combination of the original curve and will be moved, copied, or deleted along with the original one.  
Insert Points  
Delete Points  
Use the Delete Points icon to delete one or several selected points.  
If you wish to select several points click the appropriate points while holding down the Shift key.  
First select the points to be deleted, and then click this icon, or press Del.  
Delete Points  
Split Curve  
This icon splits a curve.  
Split Curve  
Convert To Curve  
Click this icon to convert a curve to a straight line and vice versa.  
If two points are selected, the curve between both points will be converted.  
If you select more than two points, each time you click this icon, a different portion of the curve will be converted.  
If necessary, round points will be converted into corner points and vice versa.  
They cannot be modified to round points unless the straight line is converted back to a curve.  
Convert To Curve  
Set Corner Point  
Click this icon to convert the selected point or points into corner points.  
A curved line, therefore, does not go straight through a corner point, but forms a corner.  
Set Corner Point  
Smooth Transition  
Click this icon to convert a corner point or symmetrical point to a smooth point.  
Both control points of the corner point are aligned parallelly, and can only be moved simultaneously.  
The control points may differentiate in length, allowing you to vary the degree of curvature.  
Smooth Transition  
Symmetric Transition  
This icon converts a corner point or a smooth point into a symmetrical point.  
Both control points of the corner point are aligned parallelly and have the same length.  
They can only be moved simultaneously and the degree of curvature is the same in both directions.  
Symmetric Transition  
Close Bézier  
Click this icon to close a line or a curve.  
A line is closed by connecting the last point with the first point, indicated by an enlarged square.  
Before inserting a new end point, the last part of the line will be opened directly in front of the start point.  
Close Bézier  
Reduce Points  
This symbol marks the current point or the selected points for deletion.  
This happens in the event that it is located on a straight line.  
If you convert a curve or a polygon with the To curve icon into a straight line or you change a curve with the mouse so that this point lies on the straight line, it is removed.  
You can set the angle from which the point reduction is to take place by choosing Tools - Options - Drawing - Grid. by choosing Tools - Options - Presentation - Grid. is 15° by default.

You will also find instructions on how to set up new data sources, how to edit existing data sources, the use of external data sources as address books when creating form letters, creating and editing database tables and queries, creating forms and linking documents with data sources.  
Shortcut Keys  
This section contains some of the most important shortcut keys used in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Terminology Made Easy  
This section provides a general glossary of technical terms used in %PRODUCTNAME along with a special list of Internet terms.  
Programming %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION  
%PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION can be controlled by using the %PRODUCTNAME API.  
%PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION now provides a new Application Programming Interface API) that enables you to control %PRODUCTNAME components by using various programming languages.  
A %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION Development Kit is available for the new programming interface.  
For more information about %PRODUCTNAME API Reference, please visit (http://api.openoffice.org /)  
The macros you have created with %PRODUCTNAME Basic based on the old program interface will no longer be supported by the current version.  
For more information on %PRODUCTNAME Basic, select "Help about %PRODUCTNAME Basic" in the list box.  
Java  
%PRODUCTNAME supports Java for running applications, Applets and JavaBeans.  
More detailed information can be found under %PRODUCTNAME Help for Java.  
For Java to work under %PRODUCTNAME, you must install the Java 2 Runtime Environment from Sun Microsystems.  
When you installed %PRODUCTNAME, you automatically received the option to install these files if they were not yet installed.  
You can also install these files now if required.  
The executable setup file is located in the %PRODUCTNAME /program folder and on the %PRODUCTNAME CD.  
The name changes accordingly for other operating systems.  
Java needs to be activated under %PRODUCTNAME to run Java applications.  
Activate Java by choosing Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Security.  
The modifications under Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Security will be used even if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is already activated.  
The modifications under Tools - Options - Internet - Proxy will also be used when starting JVM.  
Only the two lines "Http Proxy" and "Ftp Proxy" and their ports will be evaluated.  
%PRODUCTNAME and the Internet  
Here you will find information on the subject of the "Internet".  
An Internet glossary explains the most important terms.  
Options  
This command opens a dialog for a customized program configuration.  
All your settings will be automatically saved.  
The structure of this dialog is similar to the structure of the Explorer; that is, it has a hierarchical structure.  
To close the entry, simply click the minus sign before the entry or double click again this entry.  
When you open the Tools - Options dialog for the first time, you will see the User Data register.  
If you open it again, you will see the last active register.  
Select an entry to view its default settings and to be able to edit them.

Options %PRODUCTNAME  
Use this dialog to make general settings for working with %PRODUCTNAME.  
The information covers such things as user data, saving, printing, paths to important files and directories and color defaults.  
These settings are saved automatically and apply to the next session.  
User Data  
This register enables you to enter or edit user data.  
The data entered here is the data you entered when installing %PRODUCTNAME.  
Almost all the data is used by templates and AutoPilots in %PRODUCTNAME.  
For example, the "first name" and "last name" in the data fields under File - Properties is used to identify the author of a new document.  
The following user data is included automatically in an internal dictionary so the spellchecker recognizes them: company, name, street, city, title and position.  
If typing errors are made, the program can make correction suggestions.  
Changes to data take effect only after %PRODUCTNAME is restarted.  
Address  
Use the Address field to enter and edit your personal user data.  
Company  
Enter the name of your company in this field.  
First name  
Enter your first name.  
Last name  
Enter your last name.  
Initials  
Enter your initials.  
Street  
Enter or edit the name of your street in this field.

General  
This is where you can select various default settings for the saving of documents as well as the default file format.  
Load  
Load user-specific settings with the document  
Mark this check box to load the user-specific settings saved in a document with the document.  
If the check box is not marked, the following information, which is always contained in the document, will not be loaded, i.e. your own settings still apply to this document:  
Settings available under File - Print - Options,  
Name of Fax,  
Spacing options for paragraphs before text tables,  
Information about automatic updating for links, field functions and charts,  
Information about working with Asian character formats.  
Some settings are always loaded with a document, whether or not this check box is marked:  
Printer name,  
data source linked to the document and its view.  
Save  
Edit document properties before saving  
When you mark this check box, the Properties dialog will appear every time you select the Save As command.  
Always create backup copy  
Whenever a file is saved a copy is also made with its name and the .BAK extension in the Backup directory.  
The backup copy is filed in the folder that you have selected in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths as the "Backups folder".  
The default is the "Backup" folder in the %PRODUCTNAME -user folder.  
AutoSave every  
If this field is marked, %PRODUCTNAME saves the current document at intervals defined by you as if you had pressed (Ctrl) (S).  
Minutes  
Define the time interval in minutes for the automatic save.  
Prompt to save  
If you mark the Prompt to save check box, a security query will appear before the document is saved.  
Optimize XML format size (excluding pretty printing)  
If this box is checked, when saving a document %PRODUCTNAME writes the XML data without indents and line breaks.  
In this way documents are saved and opened more quickly and the file size is smaller.  
Remove the check if you want to read the XML files in a text editor in a structured form.  
URLs Relative Saving  
Here you can select the default for relative addressing of URL's in the file system and on the Internet.  
Relative addressing is only possible if the starting document and the document that is referred to by hyperlink are both on the same drive.  
A relative address always starts from the current directory in which the current document is located.  
In contrast, the absolute addressing always starts from the root directory.  
For example, your document may be located in the /work/docs C:\work\docs directory.  
There is also a /work/images C:\work\images directory.  
You can reference an image in the /work/images C:\work\images directory in the following ways:  
Examples  
File system  
Internet  
relative  
../images/img.jpg  
../images/img.jpg  
absolute  
file:///c_BAR_/work/images/img.jpg  
http://myserver.com/work/images/img.jpg  
The Help tip always displays an absolute path.  
However, if a document is saved in HTML format, %PRODUCTNAME will enter a relative path.  
File System  
Here you can specify that URLs be saved relative to a file system.  
Internet  
Select this option for the relative saving of URLs in the Internet.  
Default file formats  
Select here which file format will be applied as the default when saving the various document types.  
Document type  
Select the document type for which you want to define the default file format.  
Always save as  
Select here the file format.  
Documents of the type selected on the left will always be saved in this file format, provided that you have not selected another file format in the Save as dialog.  
Paths  
This is where you define paths to important folders.  
In the My documents entry select the folder that is to be displayed first in the Open dialog when a document is opened.  
Similarly, under Graphics select the folder that is to be displayed when a graphic is opened.  
The entries for Default Templates and AutoPilots name the folders where the links, files and folders are that otherwise are displayed as submenus under File - New and File - AutoPilot.  
This dialog enables you to select the paths to the various folders where your AutoText is contained, for example, your company's or private ones.  
The same applies for the entry Document templates.  
It may however contain several paths.  
You can also specify additional paths that are to be included with the Edit... - Add... buttons.  
These are then displayed separated by a semicolon.  
You can use a number of variables: $(inst) stands for the path of the directory in which %PRODUCTNAME was installed. $(user) stands for the path where the user installed his or her %PRODUCTNAME files during the user-defined installation.  
The path variable of the operating system can also be read.  
It is $(path).  
Type / Path  
To modify an entry in this list box, select it and click Edit.  
You can also double click the entry.  
Default  
This button resets the predefined paths for all selected entries.  
Edit...  
Click to display the Select Path or Select Paths dialog.  
Entries in the path list  
You can change the sequence of entries by clicking the bar in the Type column.  
The column width can be changed by moving the separator between the columns with the mouse.  
In the description of the paths, {netinstall} stands for the %PRODUCTNAME directory on the network server, from which the single user has run his user installation.  
The user has installed in his Home directory on his hard disk and the directory created for the %PRODUCTNAME files will be called {userinstall} in the following.  
Entries in the paths list box which indicate more than one path  
The entries AutoCorrect, AutoText, Basic, Templates and Gallery may indicate more than one path.  
In a network environment, for example, the {netinstall} directory contains several files.  
They are accessible to all users, but cannot normally be changed, since users have read-only access.  
For that reason, AutoText modules defined by the user himself are automatically placed in the directory below {userinstall}, to which he also has write-access.

{installpath}/user/wordbook  
This folder contains all custom dictionaries for the spellchecking.  
{installpath}/share/plugin or user/plugin  
This folder contains the Plug-ins that you installed in %PRODUCTNAME. %PRODUCTNAME recognizes the plug-ins installed in Netscape or the MS Internet Explorer, so you normally will not need to install plug-ins in this folder.  
Paths / Select files  
This is where you select the folders in which AutoText modules or templates are contained that are to be available in your %PRODUCTNAME.  
For form letters for e-mail, select here the files that you want to attach to the e-mails.  
Paths / Files  
Here you see the paths or files that have already been added.  
Add...  
Opens the Select Paths dialog to select another folder or the Open dialog to select another file.

This is where you choose the properties of the spellcheck, thesaurus and hyphenation.  
Some of these functions are also available in the Writing aids dialog, which you can start during the spellcheck.  
Available language modules  
Here you see the installed language modules.  
Spellcheck, hyphenation and thesaurus.  
Each sub-module can be available in one or more languages.  
If you click in front of the name of the module, in order to set a mark, you activate all the available sub-modules simultaneously.  
If you remove a set mark, you deactivate all the available sub-modules simultaneously.  
If you wish only to activate or deactivate certain sub-modules, then change to the Edit modules dialog.  
Edit  
To edit a language module, select it and click Edit.  
The Edit Modules dialog appears.  
custom dictionaries  
This List box lists the available user dictionaries.  
Check the user dictionaries that you want to use for the spellcheck and hyphenation.  
New  
This button will take you into the Apply custom dictionary dialog, in which you can determine the settings for the new custom dictionary.  
New dictionary  
In the Dictionary section you can name a new user-defined dictionary or dictionary of exceptions and specify the language.  
Name  
Enter here the name of the new custom dictionary.  
The file extension "*.DIC" is automatically appended.  
Language  
By selecting a certain language you can limit the use of the custom dictionary.  
By selecting All the custom dictionary is used independently of the current language.  
Exceptions (-)  
If you wish to avoid certain words in your documents, mark this field.  
You can include in the custom dictionary defined in this way all the words to be avoided.  
During the spellcheck, if this exception dictionary is activated, you will receive a corresponding note that this word should be avoided.  
Edit  
When you press this button the Edit custom dictionary dialog appears, in which you can add to your custom dictionary or edit existing entries.  
In this dialog you have the option to enter new terms or edit existing entries.  
If you edit an exception dictionary, the dialog has the added facility of defining an exception for a word.  
During the spellcheck this exception is then listed as a suggestion.  
When a dictionary is edited, a check is made on the status of the file.  
If, for example, it is write-protected, it cannot be changed.  
The buttons New and Delete are then deactivated.  
In such a case you must first change the status of the file.  
In a %PRODUCTNAME network installation, certain user-defined dictionaries may be located on the server in the {installpath}/share/wordbook {installpath}\share\wordbook directory.  
These are set up by the system administrator, are write-protected and include, for example, words specific to your company.  
Your own user-defined dictionaries, on the other hand, are located in the {installpath}/user/wordbook {installpath}\user\wordbook directory and can be edited.  
Book  
Here you can select the book to edit.  
In the ignore list with the name IgnoreAllList (All), which is administered only for the current spellcheck in the volatile RAM, all words are included that you have marked during the spellcheck with Ignore.  
Furthermore, some of your user data (e.g. name, company, street) will be entered in the list at the program start.  
IgnoreAllList (All) cannot be deleted.  
The IgnoreAllList entry cannot be selected and cannot be deleted.  
Only the words included as content can be deleted.  
This happens automatically each time that %PRODUCTNAME is closed.  
Language  
Here you can assign a new language to the current custom dictionary.  
Word  
Here you can enter a new word for inclusion in the dictionary.  
In the list box below you will see the contents of the current custom dictionary.  
If you select a word from this list it is displayed in the text box.  
AutoComplete=, this word is neither automatically hyphenated nor is a hyphenation suggested.  
If instead you enter the sign for example like "Auto=Complete", the word is only hyphenated, or a hyphenation suggested, at this point.  
Suggestion  
This input field is only available if you are editing an exception dictionary.  
The field takes the alterative suggestion for the word in the "Word" text box.  
With the two text boxes for editing an exception dictionary, proceed as follows:  
Assume that you are writing "E-Mail" exactly as written here.  
As an alternative you also want "email" to be offered as a correction.  
In the Word text box write E-Mail and in the Suggestion box email.  
New  
Click on this button to add the Word in the text box, and for exception dictionaries also the word appearing in the Suggestion box, to your current custom dictionary.  
Delete  
If you click the Delete button, the marked word is removed from the current custom dictionary.  
Delete  
If you click the Delete icon, you can delete the selected dictionary after a confirm overwrite, provided it is not write-protected.  
Options  
In this area you can define the options for the spellcheck and hyphenation.  
Edit  
If you want to change a value, select the entry and then click Edit.  
You will see a dialog for entering the new word.  
Check uppercase words  
If words that contain capital letters are to be checked, then mark this field.  
Check words with numbers.  
If only words that contain numbers as well as letters are to be checked, then mark this field.  
Check uppercase/lowercase  
If during the spellcheck the correct use of capitals at the start of words is also to be checked, then mark this field.  
Check special regions  
If during the spellcheck special regions are also to be checked, such as text in headers and footers, in text document tables and in text frames, then mark this field.  
Check in all languages  
If you mark here, then a match between a word and any of the installed languages is considered to be correct.  
The "Language" font attribute is therefore not taken into account.  
AutoSpellcheck  
If this function is active, the automatic spellcheck is activated.  
Any typing errors are highlighted in your document with a red underline.  
If you place the cursor over a word marked in this way, you can open the context menu to obtain a list of suggested corrections.  
Select a suggested correction to replace the suspect word with the suggestion.  
If you make the same mistake again while editing the document, it will be corrected automatically.  
These automatic replacements are only made during the current %PRODUCTNAME session.  
To place the word pair in the AutoCorrect replacement table, open the AutoCorrect context menu and choose AutoCorrect.  
Make your selection from the submenu.  
The word is replaced and at the same time the word pair is placed in the replacement table.  
Do not mark errors  
Mark this check box if you do not want the spelling errors to be indicated with a red wavy underline.  
This mode allows you to check the spelling "on the background" while typing or loading a text, but without the time-consuming red underlining.  
If you unmark the Do not mark errors box later, you will immediately see the red underlining.  
old German spellcheck  
Check this box if you would only like to apply the old German spelling rules.  
If you don't check this box, %PRODUCTNAME follows the new spelling rules for the spellcheck and hyphenation.  
Minimal number of characters for hyphenation  
A word is never automatically hyphenated if it contains less characters than you set here.  
Enter the minimum number of characters that must come before or after the hyphen.  
Characters before line break  
The number entered sets the minimum number of characters of the word to be hyphenated that must remain at the end of the line.  
Characters after line break  
The number specified in this box indicates the minimum number of characters (of the hyphenated word) required at the next line.  
Hyphenate without inquiry  
If this field is marked, you will never be asked for a manual hyphenation.  
If the field is not marked, when a word is not recognized you will be presented with a dialog for entering hyphens.  
Hyphenate special areas  
If this field is marked, hyphenation will also be carried out in footnotes, headers and footers.  
Edit module  
Edit the module here.  
Options  
In this area select a language and the module for spelling, hyphenation and Thesaurus activated for this language, and you can arrange the module by priority.  
First select the language.  
Then mark all modules that are to be activated for this language under the headings Spelling, Hyphenation and Thesaurus.  
As long as you have more than one sub-module available for one area, the sub-modules for spelling and the Thesaurus are processed in the sequence in which they are in the list box.  
You can change the sequence using the Move Up and Move Down buttons.  
Only one sub-module can be activated in hyphenation.  
Language  
Select the language here.  
A language entry has a check mark in front of it if there is a spelling module for this language.  
For all other language selection fields in %PRODUCTNAME, the following applies:  
A language entry has a check mark in front of it if the spellcheck is activated for this language.

Year (two digits)  
Select here the range, which is meant when entering a two-digit year.  
The year used to be indicated by only two digits in date entries.  
In %PRODUCTNAME, years are indicated by four digits, so that the difference between 1/1/99 and 1/1/01 is two years.  
This is where you can set the year on which two-digit dates are added to 2000.  
The limit value (e.g. "30") that you set in your operating system is the default.  
For example, if you enter a date of 1/1/30 or later, it is maintained internally as 1/1/1930 or later.

Select this option to substitute the requested %PRODUCTNAME font even if this font is available in your system.  
For example, a document that has been originally saved with Times New Roman fonts will be displayed with the substitute font even if Times New Roman has been installed in your system.  
If Always is not selected, only the fonts that do not exist in your system are replaced.  
If, for example, the font Times New Roman is available on your system and Always is not selected, this font will never be replaced.  
Screen  
If you check this box the font substitution will only take place in the screen presentation and not in the document's printout.  
You have a Postscript printer and are using a system that also supports True-Type fonts.  
To ensure that printing is always carried out using the Postscript fonts, while the screen display uses True-Type fonts, proceed as described in the following examples:

Optimized output  
Select this option for an optimized OpenGL output.  
If the "Optimized output" has been activated, all geometry data will be simultaneously transferred in an array to the graphic driver.  
But not every graphic diver correctly supports this OpenGL capability.  
For this reason, you can deactivate the "Optimized output" in case of presentation errors of 3D output.  
All geometry data will be now transferred one after the other as single components.  
Use Dithering  
Select this option to use dithering to display more colors with few colors available.  
Dithering creates the illusion of new colors and shades by varying the pattern of color pixels.  
Varying the patterns of black and white dots, for instance, produces different shades of gray.  
This option is activated by default.  
They are used to dither portrayals with fewer colors.  
Without dithering several bits of color information are omitted, making the grading distinctly visible.  
The fewer colors available, the poorer the quality.

Reduce print data  
In this area you can reduce the amount of data to be sent to the printer.  
Reducing the print data increases the print speed, page printers with a smaller memory can also print and the print files are smaller.  
The down side is reduced print quality.  
Settings for  
Select here if the following settings in this area should apply for direct printing on the printer or for printing to file.  
Reducing transparencies  
If you mark this field the transparent objects will be printed like normal non-transparent objects, depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.  
Transparency cannot at present be output directly to a printer.  
The areas of the document in which transparency is to be visible must therefore always be calculated as bitmaps and sent to the printer.  
Depending on the size of the bitmaps and the print resolution a large amount of data may thus result.  
Automatic  
With this option the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers more than a quarter of the entire page.  
No transparency  
With this option transparency is never printed.  
Reducing bitmaps  
If you mark this field, bitmaps are printed with reduced quality.  
The resolution can only be reduced and not increased.

Enumerate the name of the servers that do not require any Proxy servers.  
These are, for example, servers requested in your local network and servers with a reduced performance because of additional Proxy caching (for example, video and direct audio connections, live cameras).  
Use semicolons to separate the names.  
For example, enter "*.sun.de" (no quotation marks) to address all the hosts in the sun.de domain without proxy or "www.lifevideo.*" to address all the www.lifevideo.* hosts without proxy.  
Port  
In the text boxes, enter the port for the corresponding proxy server.  
The maximum value of a port number is fixed at 65535.  
DNS Server  
This is where you set the name of the DNS (Domain Name System).  
The DNS name server is there to translate the full name of the host that you enter as URL, e.g. www.sun.com, into its 32-bit IP address.  
The 32-bit numbers of IP addresses are shown in a simplified way as four decimal numbers separated by dots.  
Each decimal number is a number from 0 to 255, and represents the first, second, third and final 8 bits of the entire 32 bits.  
Automatic  
Automatically adopts the DNS from the system settings.  
This setting is recommended.  
This lets you, for example, when going into the Internet, automatically use the name server suggested by the provider.  
Manual  
Manual input of the DNS.  
In the text box enter the IP address of the DNS server to be used in the normal notation for IP addresses.  
Search  
Use this register to define the settings for searching in the Internet.

By the time you read this text the procedure for the Altavista example may have changed, so please alter the examples accordingly. "AltaVista(r) is a registered trademark of AltaVista Company."  
Search engines  
All user-defined search engines appear in this list box.  
Select a search engine to display its configuration in the adjacent text and option boxes.  
Name  
Enter in this text field a name for a new search engine.  
This is the name that will be displayed in the sub-menu of the Search icon.  
Type  
Use this option area to select your nexus preferences (and, or, exact) for searching more than one word while running a search and how the results should be defined and displayed in the lower text fields.  
The links And, Or and Exactly are available.  
You must always fully define all three links and after any change click the Change button.  
Prefix  
An URL can also be entered directly.  
If you are searching in one of the HTML based Internent search engines, e.g. in AltaVista for "%PRODUCTNAME", the entire URL of this search is shown in the URL input field of your browser.  
This example would give the following URL:  
http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?q= %PRODUCTNAME &kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on  
Copy everything positioned in front of the search text into the prefix field, for this example the following:  
http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?q=  
This is the first part of the search query.  
If you have entered several words separated by spaces, the sign in the Separator field will be used to link them.  
Suffix  
The search terms are passed between the prefix and the suffix.  
The suffix provides the command sequence, sent at the end of a search.  
This is as follows for this example:  
&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on  
Separator  
If you type more than one word while running a search, these words will be separated by the character specified here.  
Most search engines require the "+" character.  
How can I determine which prefixes, separators and suffixes to use when I define a new search engine?  
Activate the search engine and perform a search with at least two words.  
Copy the URL from the URL field in the Function bar and paste it into a blank document.  
Change the conditions for the search in the search engine, if it offers you the choice.  
Again, copy the contents of the URL field.  
Compare the URLs with the sample URLs which you can copy from the fields of this dialog.  
You should then be able to recognize the prefix, suffix and separator for various conditions.  
Case match  
In this list box, select the case match for running a search.  
The list box contains the following entries:  
The search terms entered are converted according to your selection.  
Many search engines handle queries differently according to their format.  
If you enter a word in lower case in AltaVista, it finds all words regardless of case.  
If the search word contains just one capital letter, then only words will be found which exactly match.  
Because of this, it's preferable not to convert words automatically, i.e., by selecting None for the case match option.  
New  
Uses this button to include a new search engine.  
New deletes all important entries of the entry mask such as "Name", "Suffix" etc.  
Enter the new search engine together with all of the necessary details.

If you check this box and select for example the Right option from the list box at the right hand side, the cursor in the spreadsheet will move into the cell to the right after you press the Enter key.  
Press Enter to switch to Edit mode  
This option allows you to immediately edit the selected cell after pressing the Enter key.  
Expand formatting  
Select this option to automatically apply the formatting attributes of the selected cell to the empty adjacent cells.  
If, for example, the contents of the selected cell have the bold attribute, this bold attribute will also apply to adjacent cells.  
Cells that already have a special format will not be modified by this function.  
You can see the range in question by pressing the Command Ctrl + * (multiplication sign on the number pad) shortcut.  
This format will also apply to all new values inserted within this range.  
The normal default settings apply to cells outside this range.  
Expand references if new columns/rows are inserted.  
Mark this check box to expand references when inserting columns or rows next to, above or below the reference range.  
This is only possible if the reference range, where the column or row is inserted, originally spanned at least two cells in the desired direction.  
Example:  
If the range A1:B1 is referenced in a formula and you insert a new column after column B, the reference is expanded by A1:C1 if there is a check in this check box.  
If the range A1:B1 is referenced and a new row is inserted under row 1, the reference is not expanded, since there is only a single cell in the vertical direction.  
If you insert rows or columns in the middle of a reference area, the reference is always expanded.  
Highlight selection in column/row headings  
Check this box to highlight column and row headers in the selected columns or rows.  
Apply printer dimensions for text formatting  
If this field is marked, printer dimensions are applied not only for printing but also for formatting the display on the screen.  
Sort Lists  
All user-defined lists will be displayed in this dialog.  
You can also define and edit your own lists.  
Lists  
Here you can see all the available lists and you can select one for editing.  
Entries  
Here you can see the content of the selected list and you can edit it.

Calculate  
Use this dialog to define the calculation settings for spreadsheets.  
Define the behavior of spreadsheets with iterative references, the date settings, the number of decimal places and if capitalization or lower cases are to be considered when comparing spreadsheets.  
Iterative references  
In this section you may delimit the number of approximation steps carried out during iterative calculations.  
In addition, you can specify the degree of precision of the answer.  
Iterations  
If you check this box, formulas with iterative references (formula that is continuously repeated until the problem is solved) will be calculated after a specific number of repetitions.  
If this box is not checked an iterative reference in the table will cause an error message (this is logical since iterative references normally result from incorrect entered cell references).  
Example:  
You want to divide up a given selling price into the net price and the value-added tax that is contained.  
You should enter, for example, the text 'Selling price' in A5, enter the text 'Net' in A6, and enter the text 'Value-added tax' in A7.  
Now enter the selling price (e.g.  
100) in B5.  
The net price should be shown in cell B6 and the value-added tax should be shown in B7.  
You know that the value-added tax is calculated as' net price times 15% 'and that you arrive at the net price by deducting the value-added tax from the selling price.  
So you should enter the formula "=B5-B7" in B6 to calculate the net price, and you should enter the formula "=B6*0.15 in cell B7 to calculate the value-added tax.  
If the iterations are switched off, an error message will appear with the following text in the Status Bar: 'Circular reference'.  
Switch on the iterations and the formulae will be calculated correctly.  
A  
B  
5  
Selling Price  
100  
6  
Net  
=B5-B7  
7  
Tax  
=B6*0,15  
Steps  
Set the maximum number of iteration steps.  
Minimum Change  
The iteration will be finished if this number is less than the amount specified in this box.  
Date  
Here you select the start date for the internal conversion from days to numbers.  
12/30/1899 (Default)  
Select this option to set that day zero will be the 12/30/1899.  
01.01.1900 (StarCalc 1.0)  
Select this option to set 1/1/1900 as day zero.  
Select this setting if you open a StarCalc 1.0 spreadsheet containing date entries.  
01/01/1904  
Select this option to set that day zero will be the 1/1/1904.  
Use this setting for spreadsheets that are imported in a foreign format.  
Case Sensitive  
Check here to distinguish between upper and lower case in texts when comparing cell contents.  
Example:  
Enter the text 'Test' in cell A1; enter the text 'test' in B1.  
Now enter the formula "=A1=B1" in cell C1.  
If the Reflect upper case/lower case field is selected, FALSE will appear in the cell; otherwise, TRUE will appear in the cell.  
The EXACT text function is always case-sensitive, independent of the settings in this dialog.  
decimal places  
Use this combo box to define the number of decimals to be displayed for numbers with the Standard number format.  
The numbers will be displayed as rounded numbers, but they will not be saved as rounded numbers.  
precision as shown  
Check this box to do the calculation using the rounded values displayed in the sheet.  
Charts will be shown with the displayed values.  
If you do not check this box, the displayed numbers will be, for example, rounded to two decimals but they will be calculated internally with the all the digits of a number.  
Search criteria = and<> must apply to whole cells  
If this option is active, the search criteria you specify for the database functions must match the whole cell exactly.  
When this field is marked, %PRODUCTNAME Calc behaves exactly as MS Excel when searching cells in the database functions.  
.* in following position:  
Search result:  
win  
Finds win, but not win95, os2win, or gewinde  
win.*  
Finds win and win95, but not os2win or gewinde  
.*win  
Finds win and os2win, but not win95 or gewinde  
.*win.*  
Finds win, win95, os2win, and gewinde  
If this check box is not selected, this "win" search pattern acts like ".*win.*", i.e. it is sufficient to insert the search pattern at any position within the cell.  
Allow regular expressions in formula  
If this field is marked, regular expressions are possible when searching and for character string comparisons.  
This relates, for example, to the Database functions, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP and SEARCH.  
Automatically find column and row labels  
If you mark this field you can use the text in any cell to lookup the column area below the text or the cell range on the right, next to the text.  
The text must consist of at least one word and should not contain any operators.  
Example:  
Cell E5 contains the text "Europe".  
Below, in cell E6, is the value 100 and in cell E7 the value 200.  
If you mark this field you can now write the following formula in cell A1: =SUM(Europe).

Use this dialog to define the grids for creating and moving objects.  
If you have activated the snap grid but wish to move or create individual objects without snap positions, keep the (command) (Ctrl) key pressed to deactivate this function for as long as needed.  
Snap  
Snap lines  
Select this option to align the contour of the graphic object to the nearest snap line.  
This will be only possible if the mouse cursor is positioned within the snap area.  
You can also define this setting by using the Snap to Snap Lines Snap to Snap Lines Snap to Snap Lines icon, which is available in the Options Bar in an opened presentation or drawing document.  
on the slide borders  
Use this option to align the contour of the graphic object to the nearest page margin.  
The cursor or a contour line of the graphics object has to be in the snap range.  
In the case of an opened presentation or drawing document, this function can also be accessed with the Snap to Page Margins Snap to Page Margins Snap to Page Margins icon in the option bar.  
Object frame  
Select this option to align the contour of the graphic object to the object frame of the nearest graphic object.  
However, the cursor or a contour line of the graphics object has to be in the snap range.  
In the case of an opened presentation or drawing document, this function can also be accessed with the Snap to Object Border Snap to Object Border Snap to Object Border icon in the option bar.  
Object points  
Select this option to align the contour of the graphic object to the object points of the nearest graphic object.  
However, this only applies if the cursor or a contour line of the graphics object is in the snap range.  
In the case of an opened presentation or drawing document, this function can also be accessed with the Snap to Object Points Snap to Object Points Snap to Object Points icon in the option bar.  
Snap range  
Use this spin box to define the distance between the mouse cursor and the object contour. %PRODUCTNAME Impress searches the nearest snap point if this distance is less than the defined distance.  
If the object contour or the mouse cursor is situated within the snap area, the object contour will be as if magnetically attracted.  
In order to avoid making "jumps" that go too far when you position and create graphic objects, you should increase the default value snap range only in small increments of about 5 to 10 pixels (matrix dots).  
Snap  
When creating or moving objects  
Graphic objects will be fixed vertically, horizontally or diagonally (45°) when creating or moving them.  
In this way, you'll create a square when drawing a rectangle and a circle when drawing an ellipse.  
You can temporarily deactivate this setting by pressing the Shift key.  
Extended edges  
This also applies to an ellipse (a circle will be created based on the longest diameter of the ellipse).  
When this option is not activated a square or a circle will be created based on the shortest width.

Scale (only in drawings)  
Drawing scale  
Select the drawing scale on the rulers.  
Drawing Options  
Use this dialog to define the global settings for drawing documents.  
You can define, among other things, the contents to be displayed, the scale to be used, the grid alignment and the contents to be printed by default.  
Zoom  
Enter here the scale for the rulers display.  
Use this tab to change the order of the ruler units to the internal units.  
After the Page Width and Page Height settings, the page size is displayed corresponding to the selected paper format.  
If you choose another scale, the display of the rulers is adjusted correspondingly.  
This way, you can adjust the rulers to the size of the objects that you draw on the page so that you can check the distances on the page in the current units.  
Enter a measure of 1:50, for example, if you want to draw a ground plan of your living room.  
In the rulers, you will then see that they no longer correspond to an area of 8 times 10.5 inches, for example, but rather to a good 32 times 43 feet.  
The objects you draw now (e.g., walls, doors, and windows) can be placed and scaled to the correct measures with numeric accuracy. (Since screens cannot yet display several feet but only several inches, however, it would be a good idea to do the entire drawing in inches or fractions of inches instead of feet.) These settings can be adjusted directly in the Rulers.)  
Scale  
In this section, you can enter changes to the scale.  
A change of the scale results in the proportional adjustment of the size in the spin buttons Original Width and Original Height.  
On the other hand, a change in one of the two spin buttons causes an adjustment of the entry in the Scale field when a suitable scale is reached.  
Scale  
Select here the scale if you want to change it proportionally.  
Select the scale from the list box or enter your own scale.  
If you do so, you can also enter 1:11 or 7:1, for example.  
Page width  
Here, you see the width of the page in the internal unit 1/100 inches.  
Page height  
Here, you see the height of the page in the internal unit 1/100 inches.  
Original Width  
This spin button shows you the new calculated original width.  
You can also enter your own value if you want different scales for the width and height.  
Original Height  
This spin button shows you the new calculated original height.  
You can also enter your own value if you want different scales for the width and height.

If a character entered here were to be positioned at the beginning of a line after a line break, it would automatically be moved to the end of the previous line.  
For example, an exclamation point at the end of a sentence would never appear at the start of a line if you enter it in this list.  
Not at end of line:  
This is where you enter characters that should not appear alone at the end of a line.  
If a character entered here were to be positioned at the end of a line due to a line break, it would automatically be moved to the beginning of the next line.  
For example, a currency symbol that appears in front of an amount (e.g. $100) would never appear at the end of a line if you enter it in this list.

Select a driver from the list and mark this box in order to pool its connection.  
Timeout (seconds)  
When a connection is pooled, here you can select the time in seconds after which the connection will be freed.  
The time can be anywhere between 30 and 600 seconds.

DCOUNT  
5  
The formula in cell B16 is =DCOUNT(A1:E10;A1:E10;A13:E14)  
Following are the parameter definitions for all database functions:  
Database is the cell range defining the database.  
Database Field indicates the database field used for further reference if such referencing is possible in a database function.  
To reference a column by means of the column header name, place quotation marks around the latter.  
Search Criteria is the cell range containing search criteria.  
If you write several criteria in one row they are connected by AND.  
If you write the criteria in different rows they are connected by OR.  
Empty cells in the search criteria range will be ignored.  
Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - Calculate to define how %PRODUCTNAME Calc is to act when searching for identical entries.  
DCOUNT  
DCOUNT counts the number of rows (records) in a database that match the specified search criteria and contain numerical values.  
Syntax  
DCOUNT(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
For the median parameter you can enter the entire database or the number zero, but the parameter cannot be empty.  
Example  
In the example above, we want to know how many children have to travel more than 600 meters to school.  
The result is to be stored in cell B16.  
Set the cursor in cell B16.  
Enter the formula =DCOUNT(A1:E10;A1:E10;A13:E14) in B16.  
Alternatively enter =DCOUNT(A1:E10;0;A13:E14) (see syntax note above).  
Functions supports range entries.  
Database is the range of data to be evaluated, including its headers: in this case A1:E10.  
Database Field specifies the column for the search criteria: in this case, Distance to School (meters).  
Search Criteria is the range where you can enter the search parameters: in this case, A13:E14.  
For example, to learn how many children in second grade are over 7 years of age, delete the entry >600 in cell D14 and enter "2" in cell B14 under Grade, and enter >7 in cell C14 to the right.  
The result is 2.  
Two children are in second grade and over 7 years of age.  
As both criteria are in the same row they are connected by AND.  
COUNTBLANK, COUNTIF.  
DCOUNTA  
DCOUNTA counts the number of rows (records) in a database that match the specified search conditions, and contain numeric or alphanumeric values.  
Syntax  
DCOUNTA(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
In the example above, you can search for the number of children whose name starts with an E or a subsequent letter.  
Edit the formula in B16 by inserting an A after the function name DCOUNT.  
Delete the old search criteria and enter >=E under Name in field A14.  
The result is 5.  
If you now delete all number values for Greta in row 8, the result changes to 4.  
Row 8 is no longer included in the count because it does not contain any values (the name Greta is text, not a value).  
COUNTBLANK, COUNTIF.  
DGET  
DGET returns the contents of the referenced cell in a database which matches the specified search criteria.  
In case of an error, the function returns either #VALUE! for no row found, or Err502 for more than one cell found.  
Syntax  
DGET(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
In the above example we want to determine what grade a child is in whose name we entered in cell A14.  
The formula is again entered in cell B16 and differs slightly from the earlier examples as only one column (one database field) can be entered for Database Field.  
Enter the following formula:  
=DGET(A1:E10;"Grade";A13:E14)  
Now enter the name Frank in A14, and you will see the result 2.  
Frank is in second grade.  
Enter "Age" instead of "Grade" and you will get Frank's age.  
11) and delete the other entries in this row.  
Edit the formula in B16 as follows:  
=DGET(A1:E10;"Name";A13:E14)  
Instead of the grade, the name is queried.  
The answer appears at once:  
Daniel is the only child aged 11.  
DMAX  
DMAX returns the maximum content of a cell (field) in a database (all records) that matches the specified search conditions.  
Syntax  
DMAX(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
How much does the heaviest child in each grade weigh?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DMAX(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
Now, under 'Grade', enter 1, 2, 3, etc. one after the other.  
After entering a grade number the weight of the heaviest child in that grade appears.  
DMIN  
DMIN returns the minimum content of a cell (field) in a database (all records) that matches the specified search criteria.  
Syntax  
DMIN(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the shortest distance to school for the children in each grade?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DMIN(A1:E10;"Distance to School";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Grade, enter 1, 2, 3, etc. one after the other.  
The shortest distance to school for each grade appears.  
DAVERAGE  
DAVERAGE returns the average of the values of all cells (fields) in all rows (database records) that match the specified search criteria.  
Syntax  
DAVERAGE(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the average weight of all children of the same age?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DAVERAGE(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Age, enter 7, 8, 9, etc. one after the other.  
The average weight of all children of the same age appears.  
DPRODUCT  
DPRODUCT multiplies all cells of a data range where the cell contents match the search criteria.  
Syntax  
DPRODUCT(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
For the birthday party example above, there is no meaningful application of this function.  
DSTDEV  
The records are treated as a sample of data.  
That is "our" children represent a cross section of all children (a representative result can not be obtained from a sample of less than one thousand).  
Syntax  
DSTDEV(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the standard deviation of the weight for all children of the same age?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DSTDEV(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Age, enter 7, 8, 9, etc. one after the other.  
The result shown is the standard deviation of the weight of all children of this age.  
DSTDEVP  
DSTDEVP calculates the standard deviation of a population based on all cells of a data range which match the search criteria.  
We, therefore, only want to make a statement about "our" children, not about others whose data we do not have.  
Syntax  
DSTDEVP(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the standard deviation of the weight for all children of the same age at Joe's birthday party?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DSTDEVP(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Age, enter 7, 8, 9, etc. one after the other.  
For each instance, the result is the standard deviation of the weight for all same-aged children whose weight we checked.  
DSUM  
DSUM returns the total of all cells in a database field in all rows (records) that match the specified search criteria.  
Syntax  
DSUM(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
How long is the combined distance to school of all children at Joe's birthday party who are in second grade?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DSUM(A1:E10;"Distance to School";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Grade, enter "2".  
As a result, you will see the sum of the distances to school of all the children who are in second grade, i.e.  
1950.  
SUMIF.  
DVAR  
The records are treated as a sample of data, we want to make a statement about all children based on "our" children (a representative result cannot e obtained from a sample popuplation of less than one thousand).  
Syntax  
DVAR(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the variance of the weight of all children of the same age?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DVAR(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Age, enter 7, 8, 9, etc. one after the other.  
For each instance, you will see as a result the variance of the weight values for all children of this age.  
DVARP  
DVARP calculates the variance of all values in the cells of a database field in all records which match the specified search criteria.  
The records are treated as an entire population, i.e. we want to make a statement about our children and not about children whose data has not been collected.  
Syntax  
DVARP(Database; Database Field; Search Criteria)  
Example  
What is the variance of the weight for all children of the same age at Joe's birthday party?  
Enter the following formula in B16:  
=DVARP(A1:E10;"Weight";A13:E14)  
In row 14, under Age, enter 7, 8, 9, etc. one after the other.  
For each instance, the variance of the weight values for all children of this age attending Joe's birthday party appears.  
Date & Time Functions  
The functions are:  
WORKDAY, YEARFRAC, DATE, DATEVALUE, EDATE, TODAY, YEAR, NOW, WEEKNUM, WEEKNUM_ADD, MINUTE, MONTH, EOMONTH, NETWORKDAYS, EASTERSUNDAY, SECOND, HOUR, DAY, DAYS, DAYS360, WEEKDAY, TIME and TIMEVALUE.  
They are described in this order below.  
Functions to compare the described function.  
%PRODUCTNAME internally handles a date/time value as a numerical value.  
If you assign the numbering format "Number" to a date or time value, 01/01/2000 12:00 PM, for example, is converted to 36526.5.  
If you do not want to see this type of numerical date or time representation, change the number format (date or time) accordingly.  
To do this, select the cell containing the date or time value, call its context menu and select Format Cells.  
The Numbers tab page contains the functions for defining the number format.  
In Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General find the area Year (two-digits).  
This sets the period for which two-digit information will apply.  
Note that changes made here have an effect on some of the following functions.  
When entering dates, note that slashes (e.g.  
07-20-54) may be interpreted as arithmetic operators.  
Thus dates entered in this way are not always recognized as dates and result in erroneous calculations.  
To keep dates from being interpreted as parts of formulas, put them in quotation marks, e.g. "07/20/54".  
WORKDAY  
The result is a date number that can be formatted as a date.  
You will then see the date of a day that is a certain number of Workdays away from the Start date.  
Syntax  
WORKDAY (Start date;Days;Holidays)  
Start date: the date from when the calculation is carried out.  
If the start date is a workday, the day is included in the calculation.  
Days: the number of workdays.  
Positive value for a result after the start date, negative value for a result before the start date.  
Holidays: list of optional holidays.  
These are non-working days.  
Enter a cell range in which the holidays are listed individually.  
Example  
What date comes 17 workdays after 1 December 2001?  
Enter the start date "12.1.2001" in C3 and the number of workdays in D3.  
Cells F3 to J3 contain the following Christmas and New Year holidays: "12.24.2001", "12.25.2001", "12.26.2001", "12.31.2001", "1.1.2002".  
=WORKDAY(C3;D3;F3;J3) returns 12/28/2001.  
Format the serial date number as a date.  
YEARFRAC  
The result is a number between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of a year between Start date and End date.  
Syntax  
YEARFRAC (Start date;End date;Basis)  
Start date and end date: two date values.  
Basis: is chosen from a list of options; indicates how the year is to be calculated.  
Basis  
Calculation  
0 or missing  
US method (NASD), 12 months of 30 days each  
1  
exact number of days in months, exact number of days in year  
2  
exact number of days in month, year has 360 days  
3  
exact number of days in month, year has 365 days  
4  
European method, 12 months of 30 days each  
Example  
What fraction of the year 2001 lies between 1.1.2002 and 7.1.2001?  
=YEARFRAC("1.1.2002 ";" 7.1.2002";1) returns 0.495890.  
DATE  
This function converts a date written as year, month, day to an internal serial number and displays it in the cell's formatting.  
The default format of a cell containing the DATE function is the date format, but you can format the cells with the 0 number format, for example, which displays the internal serial number of the date as a number.  
Syntax  
DATE(year; month; day)  
Year is an integer between 1583 and 9956 or 0 and 99.  
In Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General you can set from which year a two-digit number entry is recognized as 20xx.  
Month is an integer between 1 and 12 indicating the month.  
Day is a number between 1 and 31 indicating the day of the month.  
If the values for month and day are higher, they are carried over to the next digit.  
If you enter =DATE(00;12;31) the result will be "12/31/00." If, on the other hand, you enter =DATE(00;13;31) the result will be "1/31/01."  
You can enter dates directly into the DATE function either as arguments, or range references.  
Example  
DATE("00;1;1 ") yields 1/1/00  
DATEVALUE, TODAY, YEAR, NOW, MONTH, DAY, TIMEVALUE.

EDATE  
The result is a date which is a number of Months away from the Start date.  
Only months are considered; days are not used for calculation.  
Syntax  
EDATE(Start date;Month)  
Start date: a date.  
Month: the number of months.  
Example  
What date is one month prior to 3.31.2001?  
=EDATE("3.31.2001";-1) returns 2.28.2001.

Format the result as a number.  
DATE, YEAR, MINUTE, MONTH, HOUR, DAY, WEEKDAY.  
WEEKNUM  
WEEKNUM calculates the week number of the year for the internal date value.  
Syntax  
WEEKNUM(number; mode)  
Number is the internal date number.  
Mode sets the start of the week and the calculation type.  
1 = Sunday  
2 = Monday  
Examples  
WEEKNUM("1/1/95";1) returns 1 (1/1/95 was a Sunday)  
WEEKNUM("1/1/95";2) returns 52 (if the week starts on Monday, this Sunday belongs to the last week of the previous year).  
WEEKNUM_ADD  
The result indicates the number of the calendar week for a Date.  
Syntax  
WEEKNUM_ADD(Date;Return type)  
Date: the date within the calendar week.  
Return type:

Number, as a time value, is a decimal, for which the day is to be returned.  
Examples  
DAY(1) returns 31 (as %PRODUCTNAME starts counting at zero from December 31, 1899)  
DAY(NOW()) returns the current day.  
DAY(C4) returns 5 if the contents of C4 = 8/5/1901.  
TODAY, YEAR, NOW, MINUTE, MONTH, SECOND, HOUR, WEEKDAY.  
DAYS  
Calculates the difference between two date values.  
The result is an integer and returns the number of days between the two days.  
Syntax  
DAYS(Date_2;Date_1)  
Date_1 is the later date, Date_2 is the earlier date.  
If you enter the date values in reverse order the function returns a negative number.  
Examples  
DAYS("1/1/2010 "; NOW()) returns the number of days from today until January 1, 2010.  
DAYS("10/10/1990";"10/10/1980 ") returns 3652.  
DAYS360  
Returns the difference between two dates based on the 360 day year used in interest calculations.  
The result is an integer.  
Syntax  
DAYS360(Date_1;Date_2;Type)  
If Date_2 is earlier than Date_1, the function will return a negative number.  
The optional argument Type determines the type of difference calculation.  
If Type = 0 or if the argument is missing, the US method (NASD, National Association of Securities Dealers) is used.  
If Type<> 0, the European method is used.

Examples  
DAYS360("1/1/2000";NOW()) returns the number of interest days from January 1, 2000 until today.  
DAY  
WEEKDAY  
Returns the day of the week for the given date value.  
The day is returned as an integer between 1 (Sunday) and 7 (Saturday) if no type or type = 1 is specified.  
If type=2, numbering begins at Monday=1; and if type=3 numbering begins at Monday=0.  
Syntax  
WEEKDAY(Number; Type)  
Number, as a date value, is a decimal for which the weekday is to be returned.  
Type determines the type of calculation.  
For Type =2, the weekdays are counted starting from Monday =1.  
These values apply only to the standard date format which you select under Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - Calculate.  
Examples  
WEEKDAY("6/14/2000 ") returns 4 (the Type parameter is missing, therefore the standard count is used.  
The standard count starts with Sunday as day number 1.  
June 14, 2000 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 4).  
WEEKDAY("7/24/1996";2) returns 3 (the Type parameter is 2, therefore Monday is day number 1.  
July 24, 1996 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 3).  
WEEKDAY("7/24/1996";1) returns 4 (the Type parameter is 1, therefore Sunday is day number 1.  
July 24, 1996 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 4).  
WEEKDAY(NOW()) returns the number of the current day.  
To obtain a function indicating whether a day in A1 is a Business day, use the IF and WEEKDAY functions as follows:  
IF(WEEKDAY(A1;2)<6;"Business day";"Weekend ")  
TODAY, NOW, DAY, TEXT.  
TIME  
TIME returns the current time value from values for hours, minutes and seconds.  
This function can be used to convert a time based on these three elements to a decimal time value.  
Syntax  
TIME(hour; minute; second)  
Use an integer to set the hour.  
Use an integer to set the minute.  
Use an integer to set the second.  
Examples  
TIME("0;0;0 ") returns 00:00:00  
TIME("4;20;4 ") returns 04:20:04  
NOW, MINUTE, SECOND, HOUR.  
TIMEVALUE  
TIMEVALUE returns the internal time number from a text enclosed by quotes and which may show a possible time entry format.  
The internal number indicated as a decimal is the result of the date system used under %PRODUCTNAME to calculate date entries.  
Syntax  
TIMEVALUE("Text ")  
Text is a valid time expression and must be entered in quotation marks.  
Examples  
When formatting in time format HH:MM:SS, you then get 16:00:00.  
When formatting using the time format HH:MM:SS you then get midnight, i.e.  
DATEVALUE, NOW, MINUTE, SECOND, HOUR, TIME.

Frequency: number of interest payments per year (1, 2 or 4).  
Example  
A security is issued on 2.28.2001.  
The first interest date is set for 8.31.2001.  
The settlement date is 5.1.2001.  
The nominal rate is 0.1 or 10%, the par value is 1000 currency units.  
Interest is paid half-yearly (frequency is 2).  
How much interest has accrued?  
=ACCRINT ("2.28.2001"; "8.31.2001"; "5.1.2001"; 0.1; 1000; 2; 0) returns 16.94444.  
ACCRINTM  
Calculates the accrued interest (Accrued interest) of a security in the case of one-off payment at the settlement date.  
Syntax  
ACCRINTM (Issue;Settlement;Nominal rate;Par value;Basis)  
Issue: the issue date of the security.  
Settlement: the maturity date.  
Nominal rate: the annual nominal rate of interest (coupon interest rate)  
Par value: the par value of the security.  
Example  
A security is issued on 4.1.2001.  
The maturity date is set for 6.15.2001.  
The nominal rate is 0.1 or 10%, the par value is 1000 currency units.  
How much interest has accrued?  
=ACCRINTM("4.1.2001 ";" 6.15.2001 "; 0.1; 1000; 3) returns 20.54795.  
RECEIVED

February 15 1999, maturity date:  
May 15 1999, investment sum:  
1000 currency units, discount:  
Daily balance/360 = 2.  
The amount received on the maturity date is calculated as follows:  
=RECEIVED("2.15.99";"5.15.99";1000; 0.0575;2) returns 1014.420266.  
PV  
Returns the present value of an investment resulting from a series of regular payments.  
Use this function to calculate the amount of money needed to be invested at a fixed rate today, to receive a specific amount, an annuity, over a specified number of periods.  
You can also determine how much money is to remain after the elapse of the period.  
Specify as well if the amount is to be paid out at the beginning or at the end of each period.  
Enter these values either as numbers, expressions or references.  
If, for example, interest is paid annually at 8%, but you want to use month as your period, enter 8%/12 under Rate and %PRODUCTNAME Calc with automatically calculate the correct factor.  
Syntax  
PV(Rate; NPER; PMT; FV; Type)  
Rate defines the interest rate per period.  
NPER is the total number of periods (payment period).  
PMT is the regular payment made per period.  
FV (optional) defines the future value remaining after the final installment has been made.  
Type (optional) denotes due date for payments.  
Type = 1 means due at the beginning of a period and Type = 0 (default) means due at the end of the period.  
Example  
What is the present value of an investment, if 500 currency units are paid out monthly and the annual interest rate is 8%?  
The payment period is 48 months and 20,000 currency units are to remain at the end of the payment period.  
PV(8%/12;48;500;20000) = -35,019.37 currency units.  
Under the named conditions, you must deposit 35,019.37 currency units today, if you want to receive 500 currency units per month for 48 months and have 20,000 currency units left over at the end.  
Cross-checking shows that 48 x 500 currency units + 20,000 currency units = 44,000 currency units.  
The difference between this amount and the 35,000 currency units deposited represents the interest paid.  
Please note: references to constants must be defined as absolute references.  
Examples of this type of application are found under the depreciation functions.  
PPMT, PMT, RATE, IPMT, FV, NPER.  
SYD  
Returns the arithmetic-declining depreciation rate.  
Use this function to calculate the depreciation amount for one period of the total depreciation span of an object.  
Arithmetic declining depreciation reduces the depreciation amount from period to period by a fixed sum.  
Syntax  
SYD(Cost;Salvage;Life;Period)  
Cost is the initial cost of an asset.  
Salvage is the value of an asset after depreciation.  
Life is the period fixing the time span over which an asset is depreciated.  
Period defines the period for which the depreciation is to be calculated.  
Example  
A video system initially costing 50,000 currency units is to be depreciated annually for the next 5 years.  
The salvage value is to be 10,000 currency units.  
You want to calculate depreciation for the first year.  
SYD(50000;10000;5;1)=13,333.33 currency units.  
The depreciation amount for the first year is 13,333.33 currency units.  
To have an overview of depreciation rates per period, it is best to define a depreciation table.  
By entering the different depreciation formulas available in %PRODUCTNAME Calc next to each other, you can see which depreciation form is the most appropriate.  
Enter the table as follows:

The formula in E2 is as follows:  
=SYD($A$2;$B$2;$C$2;D2)  
This formula is duplicated in column E down to E11 (select E2, then drag down the lower right corner with the mouse).  
Cell E13 contains the formula used to check the total of the depreciation amounts.  
It uses the SUMIF function as the negative values in E8:E11 must not be considered.  
The condition >0 is contained in cell A13.  
The formula in E13 is as follows:  
=SUMIF(E2:E11;A13)  
Now view the depreciation for a 10 year period, or at a salvage value of 1 currency unit, or enter a different initial cost, etc.  
DDB, SLN, VDB.  
DISCOUNT  
Calculates the allowance (discount) of a security as a percentage.  
Syntax  
DISCOUNT(Allowance;Maturity;Price;Redemption;Basis)  
Settlement: the date of purchase of the security.  
Maturity: the date on which the security matures (expires).  
The price of the security per 100 currency units of par value.  
Redemption: the redemption value of the security per 100 currency units of par value.  
Example  
A security is purchased on 1.25.2001; the maturity date is 11.15.2001.  
Using daily balance calculation (basis 3) how high is the allowance (discount)?  
=DISCOUNT("1.25.2001 ";" 11.15.2001 "; 97; 100; 3) returns 0.03840 or 3.84 per cent.  
DURATION_ADD  
Calculates the duration of a fixed interest security in years.  
Syntax  
DURATION_ADD(Settlement;Maturity;Nominal rate;Yield;Frequency;Basis)  
Settlement: the date of purchase of the security.  
Maturity: the date on which the security matures (expires).  
Nominal rate: the annual nominal rate of interest (coupon interest rate)  
Yield: the annual yield of the security.  
Frequency: number of interest payments per year (1, 2 or 4).  
Example  
A security is purchased on 1.1.2001; the maturity date is 1.1.2006.  
The yield is 9.0%.  
Using daily balance interest calculation (basis 3) how long is the duration?  
=DURATION_ADD("1.1.2001 ";" 1.1.2006 "; 0.08; 0.09; 2; 3)  
EFFECTIVE  
Returns the net annual interest rate for a nominal interest rate.  
That is to say interest is often paid in advance with the monthly, quarterly, etc. installments prior to the end of calculation period.  
Syntax  
EFFECTIVE(NOM;P)  
NOM is the nominal interest.  
P is the number of interest payment periods per year.  
Example  
If the annual nominal interest rate is 9.75% and four interest calculation periods are defined, what is the actual interest rate (effective rate)?  
EFFECTIVE(9.75%;4) = 10.11% The annual effective rate is therefore 10.11%.  
NOMINAL.  
EFFECTIVE_ADD  
Calculates the effective annual rate of interest on the basis of the nominal interest rate and the number of interest payments per annum.  
Syntax  
EFFECTIVE_ADD(Nominal rate;Periods)  
Nominal rate: the annual nominal rate of interest.  
Periods: the number of interest payments per year.  
Example  
What is the effective annual rate of interest for a 5.25% nominal rate and quarterly payment.  
=EFFECTIVE_ADD(0.0525; 4) returns 0.053543 or 5.3534%.  
DDB  
Returns the depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the arithmetich-declining method.  
Use this form of depreciation if you require a higher initial depreciation value (as opposed to linear depreciation).  
The depreciation value get less with each period and is usually used for assets whose value loss is higher shortly after purchase (e.g. vehicles, computers).  
Please note that the book value will never reach zero under this calculation type.  
Syntax  
DDB(Cost;Salvage;Life;Period;Factor)  
Cost fixes the initial cost of an asset.  
Salvage fixes the value of an asset at the end of its life.  
Life is the number of periods defining how long the asset is to be used.  
Period defines the length of the period.  
The length must be entered in the same time unit as life.  
Factor (optional) is the factor by which depreciation decreases.  
If a value is not entered, the default is factor 2.  
Example  
A computer system with an initial cost of 75,000 currency units is to be depreciated monthly over 5 years.  
The value at the end of the depreciation is to be 1 currency unit.  
The factor is 2.  
DDB(75000;1;60;12;2) = 1,721.81 currency units.  
Therefore, the double-declining depreciation during the first month after purchase is 1,721.81 currency units.  
SYD, SLN, VDB.  
DB  
Returns the depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the double-declining balance method.  
This form of depreciation is used if you want to get a higher depreciation value at the beginning of the depreciation (as opposed to linear depreciation).  
The depreciation value is reduced with every depreciation period by the depreciation already deducted from the initial cost.  
Syntax  
DB(Cost;Salvage;Life;Period;Month)  
Cost is the initial cost of an asset.  
Salvage is the value of an asset at the end of the depreciation.  
Life Life defines the period over which an asset is depreciated.  
Period is the length of each period.  
The length must be entered in the same date unit as the depreciation period.  
Month (optional) denotes the number of months for the first year of depreciation.  
If an entry is not defined, 12 is used as the default.  
Example  
A computer system with an initial cost of 25,000 currency units is to be depreciated over a three year period.  
The salvage value is to be 1,000 currency units.  
One period is 30 days.  
DDB(25000;1000;36;1;6) = 1,075.00 currency units  
The fixed-declining depreciation of the computer system is 1,075.00 currency units.  
DDB, VDB, SYD.  
IRR  
Use this function to calculate the internal interest rate for an investment without considering costs or profits.  
This allows you to verify the profitability of an investment.  
Syntax  
IRR(Values;Guess)  
Values represents a cell reference or an array containing the values of the payment amounts.  
The initial interest rate value.  
Example  
Under the assumption that cell contents are A1=-10000, A2=13500, A3=7600 and A4=1000, a result of 80.24% is shown.  
NPV, RATE.  
ISPMT  
This function allows you to calculate the level of interest for unchanged amortization installments.  
Syntax  
ISPMT(Interest; Period; Total_periods; Invest)  
Interest sets the periodic interest rate.  
Period is the number of installments for calculation of interest.  
Total periods is the total number of installment periods.  
Invest is the amount of the investment.  
Example  
For a credit amount of 120,000 currency units with a two-year term and monthly installments, at an interest rate of 12% the level of interest after 1.5 years is required.  
ISPMT(1;18;24;120000) = -30,000 currency units.  
The total interest after 1.5 years amounts to 30,000 currency units.

The operator returns FALSE, if required by the content of the arguments.  
Syntax  
FALSE()  
Example  
If A=TRUE and B=FALSE the following examples appear:  
A AND B returns FALSE  
A OR B returns TRUE  
TRUE.  
NOT  
Reverses the logical value.  
Syntax  
NOT(Boolean value)  
Boolean Value is any value to be reversed.  
Example  
NOT(A).  
A=TRUE reverses to A=FALSE.  
OR, AND.  
OR  
Returns TRUE if at least one argument is TRUE.  
This function returns the value FALSE, if all the arguments have the logical value FALSE.  
The arguments are either logical expressions themselves (TRUE, 1<5, 2+3=7, B8<10) that return logical values, or arrays (A1:C3) containing logical values.  
If an argument entered as a matrix contains text or empty cells, these will be ignored.  
For example, formula =OR(0<C9:C16; FALSE) returns TRUE if matrix (C9:C16) contains values greater than 0, and cells containing text or empty cells may be included.  
If the range indicated does not contain any logical values, OR returns the error value #VALUE!  
Syntax  
OR(Boolean value 1; Boolean value 2 ...Boolean value 30)  
Boolean value 1; Boolean value 2 ...Boolean value 30 are conditions to be checked.  
All conditions can be either TRUE or FALSE.  
If a range is entered as a parameter, the Boolean values of the cells contained in that range are linked by the OR condition.  
The result is TRUE if the Boolean value in a cell within the cell range is TRUE.  
Example  
The logical values of entries 12<11; 13>22, and 45=45 are to be checked.  
OR(12<11; 13>22; 45=45) returns TRUE.  
OR(FALSE;TRUE) returns TRUE.  
NOT, AND.  
AND  
Returns TRUE if all arguments are TRUE.  
If one of the elements is FALSE, this function returns the FALSE value.  
The arguments are either logical expressions themselves (TRUE, 1<5, 2+3=7, B8<10) that return logical values, or arrays (A1:C3) containing logical values.  
If an argument entered as a matrix contains text or empty cells, these will be ignored.  
For example, formula =AND(0<C9:C16; C9:C16<10) returns TRUE if matrix (C9:C16) contains values between 0 and 10, and cells containing text or empty cells may be included.  
If the range indicated does not contain any logical values AND returns the error value #Wert!  
Syntax  
AND(Boolean value 1; Boolean value 2 ...Boolean value 30)  
Boolean value 1; Boolean value 2 ...Boolean value 30 are conditions to be checked.  
All conditions can be either TRUE or FALSE.  
If a range is entered as a parameter, the Boolean values of the cells contained in that range are linked by the AND condition.  
The result is TRUE if the Boolean value in all cells within the cell range is TRUE.  
Example  
The logical Boolean values of entries 12<13; 14>12, and 7<6 are to be checked.  
AND(12<13; 14>12; 7<6) returns FALSE.  
AND (FALSE;TRUE) returns FALSE.  
NOT, OR.  
TRUE  
The logical value is set to TRUE.  
The logical function TRUE verifies two arguments and returns the TRUE value if both values match.

Conditions linked by AND can be used with the function SUM() in the following way:  
You have entered your invoices into a table.  
Column A contains the date value of the invoice, column B the amounts.  
You are wanting to find a formula which you can use to return the total of all amounts only for a specific month, e.g. only the amount for the period >=1.1.99 to <1.2.99.  
The range with the date values covers A1:A40, the range containing the amounts to be totalled is B1:B40.  
C1 contains the start date, 1.1.99, of the invoices to be included and C2 the date, 1.2.99 that is to be no longer included.  
Now enter the following formula as a matrix formula:  
=SUM((A1:A40>=C1)*(A1:A40<C2)*B1:B40)  
In order to enter this as a matrix formula you must press the Shift Command + Ctrl + Enter key instead of simply pressing the Enter key to close the formula.  
The formula will then be shown in the Formula bar enclosed in braces.  
{=SUM((A1:A40>=C1)*(A1:A40<C2)*B1:B40)}  
The formula is based on the fact that the result of a comparison is 1, if the criterion is met and 0 if it is not.  
The individual comparison results will be treated as a matrix and used in matrix multiplication and at the end the individual values will be totalled to give the result matrix.

ODD  
Returns a number rounded up to the nearest odd integer.  
Syntax:  
ODD(number)  
Number is the number that is to be rounded up.  
Example:  
If you enter the number 1.01, 3 will be returned as the result.  
If you enter the number -3.01, -5 will be returned as the result.  
If you enter the number 17.9, 19 will be returned as the result.  
INT, EVEN, ISEVEN, ISODD, TRUNC, CEILING, ROUND, FLOOR  
FLOOR  
Rounds a number down to the nearest multiple of significance.  
Syntax:  
FLOOR(number; increment; mode)  
Number is the number that is to be rounded down.  
Increment is the value to whose multiple the number is to be rounded down.  
Mode is an optional value.  
If it is indicated and is not equal to zero, if the number and increment are negative, rounding up is carried out based on that value.  
It is also possible that this value is ignored after completing an import to MS Excel as Excel does not know any third parameter.  
If both parameters, Number and Significance are negative and if the Mode value is equal to zero or is not specified, then the results in %PRODUCTNAME Calc and Excel will differ after exporting.  
Example:  
If you enter the number 3.4 and the increment 1, 3 will be returned as the result.  
If you enter the number -6 and the increment -5, -10 will be returned as the result.  
If you enter the number -0.6 and the increment -0.4, -0.8 will be returned as the result.

The function returns the result 1 for a positive sign and -1 for a negative sign.  
If the number is zero, then the function likewise produces a zero.  
Syntax:  
SIGN(number)  
Number is the number whose sign is to be determined.  
Example:  
If you enter the number 3.4, 1 will be returned as the result.  
If you enter the number -4.5, -1 will be returned as the result.  
ABS  
MROUND  
The result is an integer that is the nearest integer multiple Multiple of the number Number.  
Syntax

COUNTIF  
If you want to count elements that meet with certain criteria enter the range into the Range field to define where the criteria are to be applied.  
Enter the search criteria into the Criteria field.  
Syntax:  
COUNTIF(range; criteria)  
Range is the range to which the criteria are to be applied.  
Criteria indicates the criteria in the form of a number, an expression or a character string.  
These criteria determine which cells are counted.  
For example, a search criterion may be formulated as 17, "17" ">100" or blue.  
You may also enter a search text in the form of a regular expression, e.g. "b.*" for all words that begin with b.  
You may also indicate a cell range that contains the search criterion.  
Example:  
In the example table, the criterion 22.5 is to be counted from the range A1:E4.  
You should enter Range A1:E4, along with 22.5 as the criterion, in the text box.  
1 will be returned as the result.  
COUNTIF(A1:E4;22,5) returns 1.  
A further example can be found under SUM().

This category contains the matrix functions.  
MUNIT, FREQUENCY, MDETERM, MINVERSE, MMULT, TRANSPOSE, LINEST, LOGEST, SUMPRODUCT, SUMX2MY2, SUMX2PY2, SUMXMY2, TREND and GROWTH These functions are described below.  
What is a Matrix?  
A linked range of cells on a spreadsheet containing values is described as a matrix.  
A square range of 3 rows and 3 columns is a 3 x 3 matrix:  
A  
B  
C  
1  
7  
31  
33  
2  
95  
17  
2  
3  
5  
10  
50  
The smallest possible matrix is a 1 x 2 or 2 x 1 matrix with two adjacent cells.  
What is a matrix formula?  
A formula in which the individual values in a cell range are evaluated referred to as a matrix formula.  
The difference between a matrix formula and other formulas is that the matrix formula deals with several values simultaneously instead of just one.  
Not only can a matrix formula process several values, but it can also return several values.  
The results of a matrix formula is also a matrix.  
Instead you just need to use a single matrix formula.  
Select a range of 3 x 3 cells on another part of the spreadsheet, enter the formula "=10*A1:C3" and confirm this entry using the key combination Command Ctrl +Shift+Enter.  
The result is a 3 x 3 matrix in which the individual values in the cell range (A1:C3) are multiplied by a factor of 10.  
With %PRODUCTNAME Calc, you can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), division (/), use exponents (^), concatenation (&) and comparisons (= ,<> ,< ,>, <=, >=).  
The operators can be used on each individual value in the cell range and return the result as a matrix if the matrix formula was entered.  
When changing comparison operators in matrix formulas, empty cells will follow the same rules as for a single comparison, i.e., it could be represented either by 0 or as an empty string.  
Therefore, the matrix formulas {=A1:A2= ""} and {=A1:A2=0} will both return TRUE if cells A1 and A2 are empty.  
When do you use matrix formulas?  
If the method of calculation, i.e., formula, changes, then you only have to change it once in one place.  
First select the entire matrix range and then make the required change to the matrix formula.  
Matrix formulas are also a space-saving option when several values must be calculated, since they are not very memory-intensive.  
In this case, %PRODUCTNAME has different math functions for matrices, e.g. the MMULT function for multiplying two matrices or the SUMPRODUCT function for calculating the scalar products of two matrices.  
Using Matrix Formulas in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
Of course, you can also create "normal" formulas in which the reference range, such as parameters, indicate a matrix formula.  
Therefore, not each and every value in the cell range will be calculated according to the formula; instead the result will be obtained from intersection of the reference range and the rows or columns, in which the formula is found.  
If there is no intersection or if the range at the intersection covers several rows or columns, a #value! error message will appear.  
In earlier versions of %PRODUCTNAME, a matrix was automatically created when the above-mentioned operators were applied as a parameter on the reference range.  
Thus, the formula "=Sum(B8-(B10:B12))" automatically returned the sum (B8-B10)+(B8-B11)+(B8-B12).  
This is no longer the case in %PRODUCTNAME 5.0.  
Only when the formula is explicitly given as a matrix formula in the form {"=Sum(B8-(B10:B12))"} will the specified cell range will be considered a parameter.  
If you import spreadsheet documents from older versions to %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION and have used "normal" formulae with cell areas as parameters, then you have to manually create matrix formulae from these formulae to get the same results.  
To do this you have to:  
Place the cursor in the cell containing the formula to be converted and press F2.  
Use the left arrow key and move the cursor one position to the left.  
Confirm the formula by using the key combination (Command) (Ctrl) (Shift)+(Enter).  
The formula has now been converted to a matrix formula.  
Creating Matrix Formulas  
Otherwise, only the value in the upper-left cell of the matrix being calculated would be returned.  
If you enter the matrix formula directly into the cell, you must use the key combination (Shift) (Command) (Ctrl) +(Enter) instead of the Enter key.  
Only then does the formula become a matrix formula.  
N.B.:  
You cannot create matrix formulas by manually entering the braces, as %PRODUCTNAME Calc will interpret the braces as characters.  
The cells in a results matrix are automatically protected against changes.  
However, you can edit or copy the matrix formula by selecting the entire cell range; in other words, the entire matrix.  
Editing Matrix Formulas  
Select the cell range or matrix containing the matrix formula.  
Either press F2 or position the cursor in the input line.  
Both of these actions let you edit the formula.  
After you have made changes, press (Command) (Ctrl) (Shift)+(Enter).  
For example, you can change the font color.  
Select a given cell range and then change the attribute you want.  
Copying Matrix Formulas  
Select the cell range or matrix containing the matrix formula.  
Either press F2 or position the cursor in the input line.  
Copy the formula into the input line by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) +(C).  
Select a range of cells where the matrix formula should be inserted and either press F2 or position the cursor in the input line.  
Paste the formula by pressing Command Ctrl +V in the selected space and confirm it by pressing Command Ctrl Shift+Enter.  
The selected range now contains the matrix formula.  
Adjusting a matrix range  
If you want to edit the output matrix, e.g. if the matrix formula contains a range that should be hidden, do the following:  
Select the cell range or matrix containing the matrix formula.  
N.B.:  
When you adjust the matrix range, the matrix formula will not automatically be adjusted.  
You are only changing the range in which the result will appear.  
By holding down the Ctrl key, you can create a copy of the matrix formula in the given range.  
MUNIT  
Returns the unitary square matrix of a certain size.  
The unitary matrix is a square matrix where the main diagonal elements equal 1 and all other matrix elements are equal to 0.  
Syntax  
MUNIT(Dimensions)  
Dimensions refers to the size of the matrix unit.  
Example  
Select a square range within the spreadsheet, e.g., from A1 to E5.  
Without deselecting the range, select the MUNIT function.  
Mark the Matrix check box.  
Enter the desired dimensions for the matrix unit, in this case 5, and click OK.  
You can also enter the =Munit(5) formula in the last cell of the selected range (i.e., E5), and press Shift+Command+Enter Shift+Ctrl+Enter.  
You will now see a unit matrix with a range of A1:E5.  
FREQUENCY  
Indicates the frequency distribution in a one-column-matrix.  
The default value supply and the number of intervals or classes are used to count how many values are omitted on the single intervals.  
Syntax  
FREQUENCY(Data; Class)  
Data represents the matrix of or reference to the set of values to be counted.  
Class represents the matrix of the class set.  
Example  
Note the following data.  
Column A lists measurement values (data) in no specific order.  
Column B contains the upper limit you entered for the classes, in which you want to divide the data.  
The value of 5 in cell B1 means that the first result you want from the FREQUENCY function is the number of measured values (data) less than or equal to 5.  
In B2, the next class limit is 10.  
Therefore, the FREQUENCY function should return as the second result the number of measured values that are greater than 5 or greater than or equal to 10.  
In cell B6, you entered text ">25" only for your own reference.

In this example, select the range C1:C6.  
Call up the FREQUENCY function in the Function Autopilot.  
Select the measurement range for Data in (A1:A11), and then a column for Class, in which you entered the class limits (B1:B6) Select the Matrix check box and click OK.  
You will see the frequency count in the initially selected range C1:C6.

Sheet2.A$1  
Use this function, for instance, in cell B2.  
If the cell A1 in sheet 2 contains the value -6, you can refer indirectly to the referenced cell using the function in B2 by entering =ABS(INDIRECT(B2)).  
The result is the absolute value of the cell reference specified in B2, which in this case is 6.  
COLUMN, ROW.  
AREAS  
Returns the number of areas in a reference.  
An area can be a range of contiguous cells or a single cell.  
Syntax  
AREAS(Reference)  
Reference represents the reference to a cell or cell range.  
Example  
=AREAS(A1:B3;F2;G1) returns 3, as it is a reference to three cells and/or areas.  
=AREAS(All) returns 1 if you have defined an area under Data - Define... named All.  
References to deleted sections (for example, referenced tables or columns) can be imported and exported by %PRODUCTNAME.  
ADDRESS, INDEX, COLUMN, COLUMNS, ROW, ROWS.  
DDE  
Returns the result of a DDE-based link.  
If the contents of the referenced area changes, the value returned by the formula will also change.  
Syntax  
DDE(server;file;range;mode)  
Server is the name of a server application. %PRODUCTNAME applications have the server name "Soffice".  
File is the complete file name, including path specification.  
Range is the area containing the data to be evaluated.  
Mode is an optional parameter that controls the method by which the DDE server converts its data into numbers. (This is a new parameter.  
If you open the table in an earlier version of %PRODUCTNAME Calc you should skip this parameter.)  
Mode  
Effect  
0 or missing  
Number format from the "Default" cell style  
1  
Data are always interpreted in the standard format for US English  
2  
Data are retrieved as text; no conversion to numbers  
Example  
=DDE("soffice";"c:\office\document\data1.sxc";"sheet1.A1 ") reads the contents of cell A1 in sheet1 of the %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet data1.sxc.  
=DDE("soffice";"c:\office\document\motto.sxw";"Today's motto ") returns a motto in the cell containing this formula.  
First, you must enter a line in the motto.sxw document containing the motto text and define it as the first line of a section named Today's Motto (in %PRODUCTNAME Writer under Insert - Section).  
If the motto is modified (and saved) in the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document, the motto is updated in all %PRODUCTNAME Calc cells in which this DDE link is defined.  
ERRORTYPE  
Returns the number corresponding to an error value occurring in a different cell.  
With the aid of this number, you can generate an error message text.  
The Status bar has the predefined error code from %PRODUCTNAME if you click the cell containing the error.  
Syntax  
ERRORTYPE(Reference)  
Reference contains the address of the cell in which the error occurs.  
Example  
If cell A1 displays Err:518, the function =ERRORTYPE(A1) returns the number 518.  
ISREF, ISERR, ISERROR, ISFORMULA.  
ISNONTEXT, ISBLANK, ISLOGICAL, ISNA, ISTEXT, ISNUMBER.  
INDEX  
INDEX returns the content of a cell, specified by row and column number (or an optional area name).  
Syntax  
INDEX(reference;row_num;column_name;area_num)  
Reference is a cell reference, entered either directly or by specifying an area name.  
If the reference consists of multiple defined areas, you must enclose the reference or area name in parentheses.  
row_num (optional) represents the row number of the Reference area, for which to return a value.  
column_num (optional) represents the column number of the Reference area, for which to return a value.  
area_num (optional) represents the area from which to return the row and column intersection.  
Example  
=INDEX(Prices;4;1) returns the value from row 4 and column 1 of the database area defined via Data - Define... as Prices.  
=INDEX(SumX;4;1) returns the value from the area SumX in row 4 and column 1 as defined via Insert - Names - Define....  
=INDEX((Row and Column);4;1) indicates the value contained in row 4 and column 1 of the row and column intersection named, which you named under Insert - Names - Set... as Row and Column.  
The row and column intersection may consist of several rectangular cell areas, each with a row 4 and column 1.  
If you now want to call the second block of this row and column intersection enter "2" as a final Area parameter.  
=INDEX(A1:B6;1,1) indicates the value in the upper-left of the A1:B6 area.  
VLOOKUP, MATCH, LOOKUP, CHOOSE, HLOOKUP.  
INDIRECT  
Returns the reference specified by a text string.  
This function can also be used to return the area of a corresponding string.  
Syntax  
INDIRECT(ref_text)  
ref_text represents a reference to a cell or an area (in text form) for which to return the contents.  
Example  
=INDIRECT(A1) equals 100 if A1 contains C108 as a reference and cell C108 contains a value of 100.  
=SUM(INDIRECT("a1: "& ADDRESS(1;3))) totals the cells in the area of A1 up to the cell, whose address is defined by row 1 and column 3.  
Therefore, area A1:C1 is totaled.  
OFFSET.  
COLUMN  
Returns the column number of a cell reference. if the reference is a cell the column number of the cell is returned; if the parameter is a cell area, the corresponding column numbers are returned in a single-row matrix if the formula is entered as a matrix formula.  
If the COLUMN function with an area reference parameter is not used for a matrix formula, only the column number of the first cell within the area is determined.  
Syntax  
COLUMN(reference)  
Reference is the reference to a cell or cell area whose first column number is to be found.  
If no reference is entered, the column number of the cell in which the formula is entered is found. %PRODUCTNAME Calc automatically sets the reference to the current cell.  
Example  
Column A is the first column in the table.  
Column C is the third column in the table.  
=COLUMN(D3:G10) returns 4 because column D is the fourth column in the table and the COLUMN function is not used as a matrix formula. (In this case, the first value of the matrix is always used as the result.)  
{=COLUMN(B2:B7)} and =COLUMN(B2:B7) both return 2 because the reference only contains column B as the second column in the table. (Because single-column areas have only one column number, it does not make a difference whether or not the formula is used as a matrix formula.)  
=COLUMN() returns 3 if the formula was entered in column C.  
{=COLUMN(Rabbit)} returns the single-row matrix (3, 4) if "Rabbit" is the named area (C1:D3).  
The COLUMN function is not compatible with earlier versions of %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you load older %PRODUCTNAME Calc documents please note that COLUMN() formerly returned the results in a vertical single-column m x 1 matrix instead of in a horizontal single-row 1 x n matrix.  
COLUMNS, ROWS.  
COLUMNS  
Returns the number of columns in the given reference.  
Syntax  
COLUMNS(Matrix)  
Matrix is the reference to a cell area whose total number of columns is to be found.  
The argument can also be a single cell.  
Example  
=Columns(B5) returns 1 because a cell only contains one column.  
The reference comprises three columns.  
=COLUMNS(Rabbit) returns 2 if "Rabbit" is the named area (C1:D3).  
Starting with %PRODUCTNAME 5.0, the COLUMNS function shows a different interpreting behavior than it did in older versions if you submit an internally generated matrix for a parameter.  
If you load older %PRODUCTNAME Calc documents and have used such parameters, note that COLUMNS() now returns different results (no longer the number of rows but rather the number of columns) in these cases.  
COLUMN, ROWS.  
VLOOKUP  
Vertical search with reference to adjacent cells to the right.  
The function then returns the value to the same line of a specific matrix column named by index.  
Syntax  
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value;table_array;col_index;sort order)  
Search Criterion is the value searched for in the first column of the matrix.  
Matrix is the reference, which is to comprise at least two columns.  
Index is the number of the column in the matrix that contains the value to be returned.  
The first column has the number 1.  
Sorted is an optional parameter that indicates whether the first column in the matrix is sorted in ascending order (this is the default).  
Enter the Boolean value FALSE if the first column is not sorted in ascending order.  
Sorted columns can be searched much faster and the function always returns a value, even if the search value was not matched exactly (if it is between the lowest and highest value of the sorted list).  
Otherwise the function will return this message:  
Error:  
Say you want to enter the number of a dish on the menu (in cell A1), and the name of the dish is to appear as text in the neighboring cell (B1) immediately.  
The Number to Name assignment is contained in the D1:E100 matrix.  
D1 contains 100, E1 contains the name Vegetable Soup, and so forth, for 100 menu items.  
The numbers in column D are sorted in ascending order; thus, the optional Sorted parameter is not necessary.  
Enter the following formula in B1:  
=VLOOKUP(A1; D1:E100; 2)  
As soon as you enter a number in A1 B1 will show the corresponding text contained in the second column of reference D1:E100.  
Entering a nonexistent number displays the text with the next number down.  
To prevent this, enter FALSE as the last parameter in the formula so that an error message is generated when a nonexistent number is entered.  
INDEX, MATCH, LOOKUP, HLOOKUP.  
SHEET  
Returns the sheet number of a reference or a string representing a sheet name.  
If you do not enter any parameters, the result is the sheet number of the spreadsheet containing the formula.  
Syntax  
Table(Reference)  
Reference is optional and is the reference to a cell, an area, or a table name string.  
Example  
=TABLE(Table2.A1) returns 2 if Table2 is the second table in the sequence.  
SHEETS  
Determines the number of sheets in a reference.  
If you do not enter any parameters, it returns the number of sheets in the current document.  
Syntax  
Tables(Reference)  
Reference is the reference to a table or an area.  
This parameter is optional.  
Example  
=TABLES(Table1.A1:Table3.G12) returns 3 if Table1, Table2, and Table3 exist in the sequence indicated.  
MATCH  
Returns the relative position of an item in an array that matches a specified value.  
The function returns the position of the value found in the search matrix as a number.  
MATCH(lookup_value;lookup_array;match_type)  
Search Criterion is the value which is to be searched for in the single-row or single-column matrix.  
Search Matrix is the reference searched.  
Type may take the values 1, 0, or -1.  
If Type = -1 it is assumed that the column in sorted in descending order. (This function in %PRODUCTNAME 6.0 behaves differently than in any previous version of %PRODUCTNAME; it now corresponds to the behavior of the function in Microsoft Excel.)  
If the search criterion is found more than once, the function returns the first one found.  
Only if Type = 0 can you search for regular expressions.  
If Type = 1 or the third parameter is missing, the last value that is smaller or equal to the search criterion is returned.  
This applies even when the search matrix is not sorted.  
For Type = -1, the first value that is larger or equal is returned.  
Example  
=LOOKUP(200; D1:D100) searches the area D1:D100, which is sorted by column D for instances of the value 200.  
As soon as this value is reached, the number of the row in which it was found is returned.  
If a higher value is found during the search in the column, the number of the previous row is returned.  
INDEX, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP.  
OFFSET  
Returns the value of a cell offset by a certain number of rows and columns from a given reference point.  
Syntax  
OFFSET(reference;rows;cols;height;width)  
Reference is the cell from which the function searches for the new reference.  
Rows is the number of cells by which the reference was corrected up (negative value) or down.  
Columns is the number of columns by which the reference was corrected to the left (negative value) or to the right.  
Height is the optional vertical height for an area that starts at the new reference position.  
Width is the optional horizontal width for an area that starts at the new reference position.  
Example  
=OFFSET(A1; 2, 2) returns the value in cell C3 (A1 moved by two rows and two columns down).  
If C3 contains the value 100 this function returns the value 100.  
=SUM(OFFSET(A1; 2; 2; 5; 6)) determines the total of the area that starts in cell C3 and has a height of 5 rows and a width of 6 columns, i.e. the area C3:H7.  
LOOKUP  
Returns the contents of a cell either from a one-row or one-column range or from an array.  
Optionally, the assigned value (of the same index) is returned in a different column and row.  
As opposed to VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, search and result vector may be at different positions; they do not have to be adjacent.  
Additionally, the search vector for the LOOKUP must be sorted, otherwise the search will not return any usable results.  
Syntax  
LOOKUP(lookup_value;lookup_vector;result_vector)  
Search Criterion is the value to be searched for; entered either directly or as a reference.  
Search Vector is the single-row or single-column area to be searched.  
Result Vector is another single-row or single-column area from which the result of the function is taken.  
The result is the cell of the result vector with the same index as the instance found in the search vector.  
Example  
=LOOKUP(A1; D1:D100;F1:F100) searches the corresponding cell in area D1:D100 for the number you entered in A1.  
For the instance found, the index is determined, e.g. the 12th cell in this area.  
Then, the contents of the 12th cell are returned as the value of the function (in the result vector).  
INDEX, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP.  
STYLE  
Applies a style to the cell containing the formula.  
After a set amount of time, another style can be applied.  
This function always returns the value 0, allowing you to add it to another function without changing the value.  
E.g.: =...+STYLE(IF(CURRENT()>3;"red";"green ")) applies the style" red "to the cell if the value is greater than 3, otherwise the style" green "is applied.  
Both cell formats have to be defined beforehand.  
Syntax  
STYLE(style;time;style2)  
Style Name1 is the name of a cell style assigned to the cell.  
Style names must be entered in quotation marks.  
Time is an optional time range in seconds.  
If this parameter is missing the style will not be changed after a certain amount of time has passed.  
Style Name2 is the optional name of a cell style assigned to the cell after a certain amount of time has passed.  
If this parameter is missing "Standard" is entered.  
Example  
=STYLE("Invisible";60;"Default ") formats the cell in transparent format for 60 seconds after the document was recalculated or loaded, then the Default format is assigned.  
Both cell formats have to be defined beforehand.  
CHOOSE  
Uses an index to return a value from a list of up to 30 values.  
Syntax  
CHOOSE(Index_num;value1;...value30)  
Index is a reference or number between 1 and 30 indicating which value is to be taken from the list.  
Value1...Value30 is the list of values entered as a reference to a cell or as individual values.  
Example  
=CHOOSE(A1; B1; B2; B3; "Today"; "Yesterday"; "Tomorrow"), for example, returns the contents of cell B2 for A1 = 2; for A1 = 4, the function returns the text Today.  
INDEX  
HLOOKUP  
Search for a value and reference to the cells below the selected area.  
This function verifies if the first row of a matrix contains a certain value.  
The function returns then the value in a row of the matrix, named in the Index, in the same column.  
Syntax  
=HLOOKUP(search_criteria;table_array;row_index_num;range_lookup)  
VLOOKUP (cols and rows are exchanged)  
INDEX, VLOOKUP, MATCH, LOOKUP.  
ROW  
Returns the row number of a cell reference.  
If the reference is a cell range, it returns the corresponding row numbers in a one-column Matrix if the formula is entered as a matrix formula.  
If the ROW function with a range reference is not used in a matrix formula, only the row number of the first range cell will be returned.  
Syntax  
ROW(reference)  
Reference is a cell, an area, or the name of an area.  
If you do not indicate a reference, the row number of the cell in which the formula is entered will be found. %PRODUCTNAME Calc automatically sets the reference to the current cell.  
Example  
=ROW(B3) returns 3 because the reference refers to the third row in the table.  
{=ROW(D5:D8)} returns the single-column matrix (5, 6, 7, 8) because the reference specified contains rows 5 through 8.  
=ROW(D5:D8) returns 5 because the ROW function is not used as matrix formula and only the number of the first row of the reference is returned.  
{=ROW(A1:E1)} and =ROW(A1:E1) both return 1 because the reference only contains row 1 as the first column in the table. (Because single-row areas only have one row number it does not make any difference whether or not the formula is used as a matrix formula.)  
=ROW() returns 3 if the formula was entered in row 3.  
{=ROW(Rabbit)} returns the single-column matrix (1, 2, 3) if "Rabbit" is the named area (C1:D3).  
The ROW function is not compatible with older versions of %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you load older %PRODUCTNAME Calc documents please note that ROW() formerly returned the results in a vertical single-column 1 x n matrix instead of in a horizontal single-row m x 1 matrix.  
COLUMN, ROWS.  
ROWS  
Returns the number of rows in a reference or array.  
Syntax  
ROWS(array)  
Matrix is the reference or named area whose total number of rows is to be determined.  
Example  
=Rows(B5) returns 1 because a cell only contains one row.  
=ROWS(A10:B12) returns 3.  
=ROWS(Rabbit) returns 2 if "Rabbit" is the named area (C1:D3).  
Starting with %PRODUCTNAME 5.0, the ROWS function shows a different interpreting behavior than it did in older versions if you submit an internally generated matrix for a parameter.  
If you load older %PRODUCTNAME Calc documents and have used such parameters, note that ROWS() now returns different results in these cases (no longer the number of columns but rather the number of rows).  
COLUMNS, ROW.  
Text Functions  
Here the functions associated with the Text category are explained by means of an example.  
These are described as follows.  
ARABIC  
Calculates the value of a Roman number.  
The value range must be between 0 and 3999.  
Syntax  
ARABIC (Text)  
Text is the text that represents a Roman number.  
Example  
Arabic("mxiv ") returns 1014  
Arabic("mxii ") returns 2002  
ROMAN.  
BASE  
Converts a positive integer to a specified base into a text from the numbering system.  
The digits 0-9 and the letters A-Z will be used.  
Syntax  
BASE(Number; Radix[; Minimum length])  
Number is a positive integer, which is to be converted.  
It may be any positive integer between 2 and 36.  
Minimum Length determines the minimum length of the character sequence that has been created, and can be indicated optionally.  
If this parameter is passed, a text that is shorter than the indicated minimum length will be padded on the left with nulls.  
Example  
BASE(17;10;4) returns 0017 in the decimal system.  
BASE(17;2) returns 10001 in the binary system.  
BASE(255;16;4) returns 00FF in the hexadecimal system.  
DECIMAL.  
CODE  
Returns a numeric code for the first character in a text string.  
Syntax  
CODE(Text)  
Text refers to the text for which to return a numeric code of the first character.  
Example  
CODE("Hieronymus ") returns 72, CODE("hieroglyphic") returns 104.  
The code used here does not refer to ASCII, but to the code table currently loaded.  
CHAR  
DECIMAL  
Converts a text with characters from a Number System in the base Radix into a decimal number...  
Radix must be placed in the range 2 till 36.  
Spaces and tabs are ignored, the case sensitive of Text is equivalent.  
If the radix is 16, a leading x or X or 0x or 0X and an appended h or H is disregarded.  
If the Radix is 2, an appended b or B is disregarded.  
Other characters that do not belong to the number system generate an error.  
Syntax  
DECIMAL(Text; Radix)  
Text is the text that is to be converted.  
To tell the difference, for example, between a hexadecimal number like A1 and the reference to cell A1, you have to set the number in quotation marks, e.g. "A1" or "AFFE".  
It may be any positive integer between 2 and 36.  
Example  
DECIMAL("17";10) returns 17.  
DECIMAL("FACE";16) returns 64206.  
DECIMAL("0101";2) returns 5.  
BASE.  
DOLLAR  
Converts a number to an amount in the currency format, rounded to a specified decimal place.  
In the value field enter the number to be converted to currency.  
Optionally, you may enter the number of decimal places in the decimals field.  
If no value is specified, all numbers in currency format will be displayed with two decimal places.  
Syntax  
DOLLAR(value; decimals)  
Value is a number, a reference to a cell containing a number, or a formula which returns a number.  
Decimal is the number of decimal places.  
Example  
DOLLAR(255) returns $255.00.  
DOLLAR(367.456;2) returns $367.46.  
Use the decimal separator that corresponds to the current locale setting.  
FIXED, TEXT, VALUE.  
REPLACE  
Replaces part of a text string with a different text string.  
This function can be used to replace both characters and numbers (which are automatically converted to text).  
The result of the function is always displayed as text.  
If you intend to perform further calculations with a number which has been replaced by text, you will need to convert it back to a number using the VALUE function.  
Any text containing numbers must be enclosed in quotation marks if you don't want it to be interpreted as a number and automatically converted to text.  
Syntax  
REPLACE(text; position; length; new_text)  
Old_text refers to text of which a part will be replaced.  
Start_num refers to the position within the text where the replacement will begin.  
Length is the number of characters to be replaced.  
New_text refers to the text which replaces old_text.  
Example  
REPLACE(12345.67;1;1;444) returns 4442345.67.  
The first character is replaced by the new text.  
MID, SEARCH, SUBSTITUTE, TRIM.  
FIXED  
This is where you can specify that a number be displayed with a fixed number of decimal places and with or without a thousands separator.  
This function can be used to apply an uniform format to a column of numbers.  
Syntax  
FIXED(Number; decimals; no_commas)  
Number refers to the number to be formatted.  
Decimals refers to the number of decimal places to be displayed.  
T (list of options) determines if the thousands separator is to be used.  
If T is a number not equal to 0, the thousands separator is suppressed.  
If T is equal to 0 or if T is missing altogether, the thousands separators of your current locale setting are displayed.  
Example  
FIXED(1234567.89;3) returns 1,234,567.890.  
FIXED(1234567.89;3;1) returns 1234567.890.  
DOLLAR, ROUND, TEXT, VALUE.  
FIND  
To find a certain string within a text, enter the text in the find_text field that you want to search for in the within_text field.  
You can also define where to begin the search.  
The search term can be a number or any string of characters.  
The search is case-sensitive.  
Syntax  
FIND(find_text; within_text; start_num)  
Find_text refers to the text to be found.  
Within_text is the text where the search takes place.  
Start_num (optional) is the position in the text at which to begin the search.  
Example  
FIND(76;998877665544) returns 6.  
IDENTICAL, LEN, MID, SEARCH.  
TRIM  
To remove spaces that are in front of a string or align cell contents to the left, enter that particular string as text parameter.  
Syntax  
TRIM(Text)

Example  
TRIM( "hello") returns hello.  
CLEAN, REPLACE, MID, SUBSTITUTE.  
UPPER  
Converts the string specified in the Text field to uppercase.  
Syntax  
UPPER(Text)  
Text refers to the text in which lower case letters should be converted to capitals.  
Example  
UPPER("Good Morning ") returns GOOD MORNING.  
LOWER, PROPER.  
PROPER  
Capitalizes the first letter in a text string and all other letters after each space.  
Syntax  
PROPER(Text)  
Text refers to the text in which the first letters of words should be replaced with a capital.  
Example  
PROPER("sun microsystems ") returns Sun Microsystems.  
UPPER, LOWER.  
EXACT  
Compares two text strings and returns TRUE if they are exactly the same, FALSE otherwise.  
This function is case-sensitive.  
Syntax  
IDENTICAL(text 1;text 2)  
Text 1 refers to the first text to compare.  
Text 2 is the second text to compare.  
Example  
EXACT("Sun microsystems";"Sun Microsystems ") returns FALSE.  
LEN, SEARCH.  
LOWER  
Converts all uppercase letters in a text string to lowercase.  
Syntax  
LOWER(Text)  
Text refers to the text in which capital letters should be replaced by lower case letters.  
Example  
LOWER("Sun ") returns sun.  
PROPER, UPPER.  
LEFT  
Returns the first character or the first number characters in a string.  
Syntax  
LEFT(text; number)  
Text is the text of which the left part is to be determined.  
Number (optional) specifies the number of characters for the left part of the text.  
If this parameter is not defined, one character is returned.  
Example  
LEFT("output";3) returns out.  
MID, RIGHT.  
LEN  
Returns the length of a string including spaces.  
Syntax  
LEN(Text)  
Text is the text whose length is to be determined.

LEN(12345.67) returns 8.  
EXACT, SEARCH.  
RIGHT  
Returns the last character or the last number of characters in a string.  
Syntax  
RIGHT(text; number)  
Text is the text whose right text segment is to be specifyd.  
Number (optional) is the number of characters from the right part of the text.  
Example  
RIGHT("Roast Turkey";3) returns key.  
LEFT, MID.  
ROMAN  
Converts a number into a Roman number.  
The value range must be between 0 and 3999, the value of the modi is limited to between 0 and 4.  
Syntax  
ROMAN (Number; mode)  
Number is the number that is to be converted into a Roman numeral.  
Mode (list of options) indicates the degree of simplification.  
The higher the value, the greater is the simplification of the Roman number.  
Example  
ROMAN(999) returns CMXCIX

ARABIC  
SEARCH  
This function returns the position of a text segment within a character string.  
You can set the start of the search as an option.  
The search text can be a number or any sequence of characters.

AddIn concept  
You will also find a description of the %PRODUCTNAME Calc-AddIn-Interface in the Help.  
In addition, important functions and their parameters are described in the Help for the Shared Library %PRODUCTNAME Calc-Add-In-DLL.  
AddInns supplied  
%PRODUCTNAME contains examples for the AddIn interface of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
If you have installed AddIns, they are located in {installpath}/program/addin Shared Libraries DLLs.  
These provide the functions that you find in AutoPilot:  
Functions under the AddIn category.  
Analysis Functions Part One  
Analysis Functions Part Two  
Furthermore, a folder named "source" is found under the Add-In directory.  
This folder contains the source code for the Shared Libraries DLLs and provides interesting programming examples in an overview of the Add-In- Shared Library DLL functions.

Add-ins via %PRODUCTNAME API  
Add-Ins can also be implemented via the %PRODUCTNAME API.  
You have to define a Service supporting com::sun::star::sheet::AddIn and register an implementation of it.  
You can get more information about %PRODUCTNAME API documentation for advanced users by requesting it.  
Add-in for Programming in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
An Add-In can be attached to %PRODUCTNAME Calc, which is an external programming module providing additional functions for working with spreadsheets.  
These are displayed in the Function AutoPilot in the Add-In category.  
If you would like to program such an Add-In yourself, you can learn here which functions must be exported by the Shared Library external DLL so that the Add-In can be successfully attached.  
%PRODUCTNAME searches the path defined in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Path for modules according to a subordinate "addin" and examines these against a suitable Shared library DLL.  
In order for this DLL to be recognized by %PRODUCTNAME, it must have certain properties, as explained in the following.  
This information allows you to program your own AddIn for AutoPilot:  
Functions of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Included in the program package are two samples of an Add-In interface of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
If you indicated during installation of the program that Add-Ins are also to be installed, an "addin" directory is included in the Office directory, which contains sample DLLs as well as an additional "source" subdirectory listing the source code.  
A description of the add-in functions provided by the sample DLLs can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help about the Function AutoPilot in the add-in category.  
The Add-In Concept  
Each Add-In library provides several functions.  
Some functions are used for management purposes and must follow a certain convention.  
Through these functions information about other functions is available, which make up the extension of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
You can choose any name for these functions.  
However, they must also follow certain rules regarding parameter passing.  
The exact naming and calling conventions vary for different platforms.  
Under Windows, the Pascal conventions are used, among others, because Pascal is still widely common.  
Functions of Shared Library AddIn DLL  
At a minimum, the management functions GetFunctionCount and GetFunctionData must exist.  
Using these, the functions as well as parameter types and return values can be determined.  
For return values, the Double and String types are supported.  
For additional parameters, the cell areas Double Array, String Array, and Cell Array are supported.  
Parameters are passed using references.  
Therefore, a change of these values is basically possible.  
However, this is not supported in %PRODUCTNAME Calc because it does not make sense within spreadsheets.  
Libraries can be reloaded during load time and their contents can be analyzed using the two management functions.  
For each function, information about parameter number and type, application internal and real names as well as management numbers is available.  
The functions are called synchronously and return their results immediately.  
Real time functions (asynchronous functions) are also possible; however, they are not explained in detail because of their complexity.  
General information about the interface  
The maximum number of parameters in an Add-In function attached to %PRODUCTNAME Calc is 16: one result value and a maximum of 15 input function parameters.  
The data types are defined as follows:  
Data types  
Definition  
CALLTYPE  
Under Windows:  
FAR PASCAL (_far _pascal)  
other: default (operating system specific default)  
USHORT  
2 Byte unsigned Integer  
double  
8 byte platform-dependent format  
Paramtype  
platform-dependent like int  
PTR_DOUBLE =0 pointer to a double  
PTR_STRING =1 pointer to a zero-terminated string  
PTR_DOUBLE_ARR =2 pointer to a double array  
PTR_STRING_ARR =3 pointer to a string array  
PTR_CELL_ARR =4 pointer to a cell array  
NONE =5  
Shared Library DLL functions  
Following you will find a description of those functions, which are called at the Shared Library external DLL.  
For all Shared Library DLL functions applies:  
void CALLTYPE fn(out, in1, in2,...)  
Output:  
Resulting value  
Input:  
Any number of types (double&, char*, double*, char**, Cel area), where the Cell area is an array of types double array, string array, or cell array.  
GetFunctionCount()  
Returns the number of functions without the management functions of the reference parameter.  
Each function has a unique number between 0 and nCount-1.  
This number will be needed for the GetFunctionData and GetParameterDescription functions later.  
Syntax  
void CALLTYPE GetFunctionCount(USHORT& nCount)  
Parameter  
USHORT &nCount:  
Output:  
Reference to a variable, which is supposed to contain the number of Add-In functions.  
E.g.:  
If the Add-In provides 5 functions for %PRODUCTNAME Calc, then nCount=5.  
GetFunctionData()  
Determines all the important information about an AddIn function.  
Syntax  
void CALLTYPE GetFunctionData(USHORT& nNo, char* pFuncName, USHORT& nParamCount, Paramtype* peType, char* pInternalName)  
Parameter  
USHORT& nNo:  
Input:  
Function number between 0 and nCount-1, inclusively.  
char* pFuncName:  
Output:  
Function name as seen by the programmer, as it is named in the Shared Library DLL.  
This name does not determine the name used in the function AutoPilot.  
USHORT& nParamCount:  
Output:  
Number of parameters in AddIn function.  
This number must be greater than 0, because there is always a result value; the maximum value is 16.  
Paramtype* peType:  
Output:  
Pointer to an array of exactly 16 variables of type Paramtype.  
The first nParamCount entries are filled with the suitable type of parameter.  
char* pInternalName:  
Output:  
Function name as seen by the user, as it appears in the Function AutoPilot.  
May contain umlauts.  
The pFuncName and pInternalName parameters are char arrays, which are implemented with size 256 in %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
GetParameterDescription()  
Provides a brief description of the AddIn function and its parameters.  
As an option, this function can be used to show a function and parameter description in the function AutoPilot.  
Syntax  
void CALLTYPE GetParameterDescription(USHORT& nNo, USHORT& nParam, char* pName, char* pDesc)  
Parameter  
USHORT& nNo:  
Input:  
Number of the function in the library; between 0 and nCount-1.  
USHORT& nParam:  
Input:  
Indicates, for which parameter the description is provided; parameters start at 1.  
If nParam is 0, the description itself is supposed to be provided in pDesc; in this case, pName does not have any meaning.  
char* pName:  
Output:  
Takes up the parameter name or type, e.g. the word "Number" or "String" or "Date", etc.  
Implemented in %PRODUCTNAME Calc as char[256].  
char* pDesc:  
Output:  
Takes up the description of the parameter, e.g. "Value, at which the universe is to be calculated." Implemented in %PRODUCTNAME Calc as char[256].  
pName and pDesc are char arrays; implemented in %PRODUCTNAME Calc with size 256.  
Please note that the space available in the Function AutoPilot is limited and that the 256 characters cannot be fully used.  
Cell areas  
The following tables contain information about which data structures must be provided by an external program module in order to pass cell areas. %PRODUCTNAME Calc distinguishes between three different arrays, depending on the data type.  
Double Array  
As a parameter, a cell area with values of the Number/Double type can be passed.  
A double array in %PRODUCTNAME Calc is defined as follows:

Forward to Financal Functions Part Three  
Parameter of the function DAYS360  
The interpreter behavior of the DAYS360 function was changed with the release of %PRODUCTNAME 5.2.  
So when you recalculate documents from previous versions you may get different results.  
In this section "Old:" means behavior of %PRODUCTNAME prior to version 5.2, and "New:" refers to behavior with effect from %PRODUCTNAME 5.2.  
Note:  
DAYS360 calculates intervals on the basis of 30-day-months, the last day of the month is always the 30th. (the 31st. will be handled as 30th.), with the exception of February.  
February is especially handled.  
The modifications are:  
Old:  
If the third optional parameter was not entered, it would have been interpreted as non 0 (TRUE) (European method).  
If the third optional parameter is not entered, it will be now interpreted as =0 (FALSE) (US method (NASD)).  
Old:  
If the date 2/28 was a leap year, it would have been converted to 2/29 if the third parameter had been previously entered and was FALSE.  
New: if the date 2/28 is a leap year, it will always remain 2/28.  
The table shows a short summary.  
Date  
Leap year  
Parameter Type  
Old:  
New:  
2/28.

FALSE

no  
TRUE  
remained 28.  
remains 28.  
2/29.  
yes  
TRUE  
remained 29.  
remains 29.  
Furthermore, the following applies:  
If the earlier date is a 31st. and the third parameter is FALSE and the old date was not any 30th. (after a possible conversion of a date such as 2/28-2/29 or 31), then the earlier date will be set on the 1st. of the following month.  
If the earlier date is a 31st. and the third parameter is TRUE or the previous date was a 30th., then the earlier date will be set on the 30th.  
The approach is (Old:/New:) remaining equal, but the result can be modified via the modified default values with a missing third parameter.  
Example  
Old: =DAYS360( "03/01/00"; "03/31/00") = 29  
New: =DAYS360( "03/01/00";"03/31/00") = 30  
=DAYS360( "03/01/00"; "03/31/00"; FALSE) = 30  
=DAYS360( "03/01/00"; "03/31/00"; TRUE) = 29  
=DAYS360( "02/28/00"; "03/01/00") = 3  
Old: =DAYS360( "02/28/00";"03/01/00"; FALSE) = 2  
New: =DAYS360( "02/28/00"; "03/01/00"; FALSE) = 3  
=DAYS360( "02/28/00"; "03/01/00"; TRUE) = 3  
Old: =DAYS360( "02/29/00"; "03/01/00") = 2  
New: =DAYS360( "02/29/00";"03/01/00") = 1  
=DAYS360( "02/29/00"; "03/01/00"; FALSE) = 1  
=TAGE360( "02/29/00"; "01/03/00"; TRUE) = 2

CHIINV  
Returns the inverse of the one-tailed probability of the chi-squared distribution.  
The Chi square distribution is a distribution from statistics that is taken as the basis for the "Chi square test".  
A hypothesis is examined in this test:  
If the observed extent of randomness is sufficient for the preset distribution law (thus the Chi square distribution), then the hypothesis is confirmed.  
Granted the assumption that the hypothesis is correct, the observed Chi square would have to correspond to the hypothetical Chi square of the theoretical Chi square distribution (at least roughly).  
Chi square is determined as the sum of  
(observed value-expected value)^2/expected value  
for all values.  
Since Chi square is a measure of the deviation from the true (observed) distribution from the hypothetical (theoretical) distribution, the hypothesis will be rejected if the value calculated for Chi square from a concrete random sample exceeds a certain critical value.  
It can also be found in tables in mathematical reference works.  
Syntax  
CHIINV(number; degrees_freedom)  
Number is the value of the error probability, where the critical size CHIINV should be calculated, in other words, it is the probability that secures the hypothesis.  
Degrees_freedom is the degrees of freedom of the experiment.  
Example  
A die is thrown 1020 times.  
The numbers on the die 1 through 6 come up 195, 151, 148, 189, 183 and 154 times (observation values).  
The hypothesis that the die is not fixed is to be tested.  
The Chi square distribution of the random sample is determined by the formula given above.  
Since the expected value for a given number on the die for n throws is n times 1/6, thus 1020/6 = 170, the formula returns a Chi square value of 13.27.  
If the (observed) Chi square is greater than or equal to the (theoretical) Chi square CHIINV, the hypothesis will be discarded, since the deviation between theory and experiment is too great.  
If the observed Chi square is less that CHIINV, the hypothesis is confirmed with the indicated probability of error.  
=CHIINV(0,05; 5) returns 11,07.  
=CHIINV(0,02; 5) returns 13.39.  
If the probability of error is 2%, there is no reason to believe it is fixed.

This is the probability which suffices the observed data of the theoretical Chi-square distribution.  
CHIINV, CHIDIST  
CHIDIST  
Returns the probability value from the indicated Chi square that a hypothesis is confirmed.  
CHIDIST compares the Chi square value to be given for a random sample that is calculated from the sum of (observed value-expected value)^2/expected value for all values with the theoretical Chi square distribution and determines from this the probability of error for the hypothesis to be tested.  
The probability determined by CHIDIST can also be determined by CHITEST, in which case instead of the Chi square of the random sample, the observed and expected data must be passed as the parameter.  
Syntax

Conditional Formatting  
Choose Conditional Formatting to define format styles depending on certain conditions.  
If a style was already assigned to a cell, it remains unchanged.  
The style entered here will be then evaluated.  
You can enter 3 conditions, which query the contents of cell values or formulas.  
The conditions are queried from 1 to 3.  
Otherwise, the condition 2 will be queried and the defined style used.  
If this style does not match, the condition 3 will be queried.  
Conditional formatting has been used in the "Details" table contained in this document.  
Condition 1/2/3  
Check this box to define a condition.  
Check the boxes corresponding to each condition and enter the respective condition.  
To close the dialog, click OK.  
Cell value/Formula  
Specify if the conditional formatting should be dependent on a cell value or a formula.  
If you select a formula as a reference, the combo box Cell Value Condition will be displayed on the right of the Cell value/Formula field.  
If the condition is "Is formula" enter a cell reference; if the cell reference is a value other than zero, the condition will match.  
Cell Value Condition  
Choose a condition for the format to be applied to the selected cells.  
Cell style  
Choose the style to be applied if the specified condition matches.  
Parameter field  
Enter a reference, value or formula here.  
Enter a reference, value or formula in the parameter field (or in both parameter fields if you have selected a condition that requires two parameters).  
You can also enter formulas containing relative references.  
Once the parameters have been defined, the condition is complete.  
It may appear, for example, as:  
Cell value is equal 0:  
Cell style Null value (You must have already defined a cell style with this name before assigning it to a condition).  
Cell value is between $B$20 and $B$21:  
Cell style Result (The corresponding value limits must already exist in cells B20 and B21)  
Formula is SUM($A$1:$A$5)=10:  
Cell style Result (The selected cells are formatted with the Result style if the sum of the contents in cells A1 to A5 is equal to 10.  
Cell style  
Here, you can create a cell style.  
Numbers  
Hyphenation  
This menu command calls the dialog for setting the hyphenation in %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
You can only turn on the automatic hyphenation in %PRODUCTNAME Calc when the row break feature is active.  
Hyphenation for selected cells.  
Select the cells for which you want to change the hyphenation.  
Choose Tools - Hyphenation.  
The Cell Attributes dialog appears with the Alignment tab page.  
Mark the Hyphenation active check box.  
Hyphenation for Drawing Objects  
Select a drawing object.  
Choose Tools - Hyphenation.  
Each time you call the command you turn the hyphenation for the drawing object on or off.  
A check mark shows the current status.  
Detective  
This command activates the Spreadsheet Detective.  
With the Detective, you can make the links between the current formula cells and the cells in the spreadsheet document visible.  
If you define an icon in the spreadsheet, you can put your cursor on it.  
It will change into a magnifying glass with reference arrows.  
Double-click the visible icon to select the cell at the furthest end of the icon.  
Trace Precedents  
This function shows the relationship between the current cell containing a formula and the cells used in the formula.  
The displaying of traces in the sheet is done by using marking arrows.  
At the same time the range of all the cells contained in the formula of the current cell is highlighted with a blue frame.  
This function is based on a principle of layers.  
For example, if the precedent cell to a formula is already indicated with a tracer arrow, when you repeat this command, the tracer arrows are drawn to the precedent cells of this cell.  
Remove Precedents  
Deletes one level of trace arrows (inserted with Trace Precendents).  
Trace Dependents  
Draws tracer arrows to the active cell from formulas that depend on values in the active cell.  
Additionally, the area of all cells that are used together with the active cell in a formula is highlighted by a blue frame.  
This function works per level.  
For instance, if one level of traces has already been activated to show the Precedents (or dependents), then you would see the next dependency level by activating the Trace function again.  
Remove Dependents  
Deletes one level of tracer arrows created with Trace Dependents.  
Remove All Traces  
Removes all tracer arrows from the spreadsheet.  
Trace Error  
This function draws tracer arrows to all cells which cause an error value in a selected cell.  
Fill Mode  
This command activates the Fill mode in the Detective.  
The mouse pointer changes to a special symbol, and you can click any cell to see a trace to the precedent cell.  
To exit this mode, press Escape or click the End Fill Mode command in the context menu.  
The Fill Mode function is identical with the Trace Precedent command if you call this mode for the first time.  
Use the context menu to select further options for the Fill Mode and to exit this mode.  
Mark invalid data  
This command marks all cells in the sheet, containing values outside the validation rules.  
The validity rules restrict the input of numbers, dates, time values and text to certain values.  
However, it is possible to enter invalid values (if the Stop action is not selected) or copy invalid values into the cells.  
When you assign a validity rule, existing values in a cell will not be modified.  
Refresh Traces  
Use this command to redraw all traces in the sheet.  
The modified formulas by the redrawing of the traces are also considered.  
Detective arrows in the document are updated under the following circumstances:  
Starting Tools - Detective - Update Refresh Traces  
If Tools - Detective - Update Automatically is turned on, every time formulas are changed in the document.  
AutoRefresh  
Use this button to automatically refresh all the traces in the sheet when you modify a formula.  
Goal Seek  
Opens a dialog where you can specify a target value for a selected cell.  
After a successful search you will see a dialog with the results, allowing you to apply the target value directly to the cell.

The button on the right offers you an overview of all the scenarios in this area, if several have been defined.  
You can choose any of the scenarios from this list without restrictions..  
Copy back  
If this check box has been activated the data will first of all be copied back into the active scenario if one has been selected from the list.  
Afterwards, you can edit the data for each scenario directly in the sheet.  
If this option has not been selected together with Display border in you will not be able to see scenarios in the sheet.  
In this case, the Navigator will help you.  
Click the Scenarios button located in the Navigator to show and then select one of the defined scenarios for this sheet.

As an option, you can define a password for the appropriate section.  
Spreadsheets  
Documents  
protecting sheet  
Choose Tools - Protect Document - Sheet to open the Protect Sheet dialog in which you then specify sheet protection with or without a password.  
To protect the cells of the table from further editing the locked check box must be checked on the Format - Cell... - Cell Protection menu or on the Format Cells... context menu  
Unprotected cells or cell areas can also be set up in an otherwise protected environment by using the Tools - Protect Document - Table... and Format - Cell... - Cell Protection menus (or the Format Cells... - Cell Protection context menu).  
First, select the "free" area, and then display the Cell Protection tab on the Format - Cell... menu or on the Format Cells context menu.  
In the Disable Protection section, uncheck the locked check box and click OK.  
On the Tools - Protect Document - Table... menu, activate protection for the table.  
Effective immediately, only the area you defined can be edited.  
Next, on the Format - Cell... - Cell Protection menu or on the corresponding context menu, check the locked check box.  
The previously editable area is now protected.  
Table protection also applies to the context menu of the Table tab at the bottom of the screen.  
The Delete... and Move/Copy... commands cannot be selected.  
A protected table or table area can no longer be changed until this protection is disabled.  
To disable the protection, choose the Tools - Protect Document - Table... command again.  
If no password was set the table protection is immediately disabled.  
If the table was password protected you will see the Remove Protection dialog where you must enter the password.  
Only then is the checkmark indicating the protection removed.  
Once saved, protected tables can only be saved again by using the File - Save As... command, which makes it more difficult to accidentally overwrite the file.  
Password (optional)  
To protect your sheet from unauthorized changes, enter a password here.  
Complete protection of your work can be achieved by combining both options on the Tools - Protect Document menu, including password protection.  
To prohibit opening the document altogether, first enable the Save with password field during the initial save before you click the Save button.  
The Enter Password dialog appears where you can enter an appropriate string and confirm it with OK.  
Note that if you forget the password you will not be able to access your document.  
Protecting document  
Specify here the necessary settings, with or without password, in order to protect the document.  
The structure of protected spreadsheet documents can be changed only if the Protect option is disabled.  
You can select either Delete... or Move/Copy... or another option.  
To remove the protection, once again call up the command Tools - Protect Document - Document....  
If no password is assigned, protection is immediately removed.  
If you were assigned a password, you can now view the dialog Remove Spreadsheet Protection, in which you must enter the password.  
Only then will the check mark specifying that protection is active be removed.  
This makes it more difficult to save incorrect changes to the file.  
Password (optional)  
Enter you password to protect your document against unauthorized or accidental modifications.  
You will be able to completely protect your work by combining both options from Tools - Protect Document, including password entry.  
If you want to prevent the document from being opened by other users, select Save With Password and click the Save button.  
The Enter Password dialog appears, in which you can enter a string of characters and confirm it by clicking OK.  
Consider carefully when choosing a password; if you forget it after you close a document you will be unable to access the document.  
AutoCalculate  
If you choose this option, formulas will be automatically recalculated, and if necessary, the results will be corrected.  
All cells are recalculated after a sheet cell has been modified.  
Any charts in the sheet will also be refreshed.  
If this button is activated, the Recalculate function (F9) is not available.  
Recalculate  
Recalculates the current sheet immediately.  
Use this command if you deselected the automatic recalculation or if you want to be sure that you get the real new recalculated status (especially in very large sheets).  
After the document has been recalculated, the display is refreshed.  
Any charts contained in the sheet are also refreshed.  
With the shortcut keys (Shift)(Ctrl)(F9)you can force a recalculation of all cells.  
AutoInput  
Use this command to turn the AutoInput on and off.  
The AutoInput function automatically completes the strings you enter with a string beginning with the same characters if they already exist in the column.  
The whole column is taken into account with a limit of 2000 cells or 200 different characters being in place.  
When typing in formulas (input begins with an equals sign) using characters that match previous entries, a Help tip will appear listing the last ten functions used from AutoPilot for functions, from all defined range names, from all database range names and from the content of all label ranges.  
Use the Tab key to move forwards through the selection in the Help tip (provided there is more than one match) and Shift+Tab to move backwards.  
To accept the Help tip suggestion, press the Return key.  
AutoInput is case-sensitive.  
If, for example, you have written "Total" in one cell of a column, you cannot enter "total" in the another cell of that column without first deactivating AutoInput.  
If several cell entries match, a selection list is compiled.  
To see the list for the column being edited, choose Selection List... from the context menu or press Ctrl+D.  
Cell Contents  
Open a submenu with commands to calculate tables and activate AutoInput.  
Split  
When you activate this menu item, the current window is divided at the top left corner of the active cell.  
You can also use the mouse to split the workpage window horizontally or vertically.  
To accomplish this, drag the thick black line located directly above the vertical scroll bar or directly to the right of the horizontal scroll bar into the workpage.  
A thick black line will show where the workpage is split.  
A split window has its own scroll bars in each partial section; by contrast, fixed window sections are not scrollable.  
Freeze  
When you activate this function, the sheet is divided at the top left corner of the active cell and the area to the top left is frozen, i.e. not longer scrollable.  
Use this dialog to define a database range in your sheet.  
Name

If you check this box, the first selected row in the sheet is omitted in the sort function.  
Include formats  
If this check box is not selected, all formatting in the individual cells remain unchanged after being sorted, even if the cell contents change.  
Usually formatting is applied to an entire cell, not the cell contents.  
If the check box is active, however, the formatting made to the text present in the cell is connected to the text and is moved to the target location if sorting takes place.  
Copy sort results to:  
If you choose this option, the sort results will be saved in a predefined sheet area.  
Sort results  
If you have defined a sheet area, you can select it here.

Mark this check box to select a range where you want the filter results to appear.  
You can select a named range from the list box.  
You can also select a range directly in the sheet which will be the output range for the filter results.  
The AutoFilter list boxes are then displayed only in the new output range.  
Regular expression  
Check this box if you want to use placeholders in the filter. %PRODUCTNAME supports following placeholders:  
Character  
Effect/usage  
.  
Uses the entry "Jens.n" to find the terms "Jensen" and "Jenson".  
^Peter  
Finds the word only if it is located at the beginning of a paragraph.  
Peter$  
Finds the word only if it is located at the end of a paragraph.  
*  
This represents a character or characters that may occur not at all or any number of times. "Peter .*home" will find "Peter went home" and "Peter is at home".  
+  
The preceding character must occur at least once and may occur any number of times greater than one: "AX.+4" finds "AX 4", but not "AX4"  
\t  
Finds a tab.  
()  
Forms alternate groups for the search: "(Peter has) _BAR_ (Peter gets)" will find both "Peter has" and "Peter gets" in the course of a search.  
\>  
The search text must occur at the end of the word: "pipe\>" will find "stovepipe", but not "pipeline".  
\<  
The search text must occur at the beginning of the word: "\<pipe" will find "pipeline", but not "stovepipe".  
If the regular expressions are activated, EQUAL (=) and NOT EQUAL (<>) also apply for comparisons.  
The same applies for functions that always work with regular expressions for strings:  
DCOUNTA, DGET, MATCH, COUNTIF, SUMIF, LOOKUP, VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP.  
No duplication  
Check here to exclude duplicate rows in the list of filtered data.  
Several equal results are reduced to one entry.  
Keep filter criteria  
When you mark the Copy results to check box and specify a target range, you can use this check box to determine that the target range should remain linked to the source range.  
The source range must have previously been defined as data range via Data - Define Database Range.  
The filter defined in this way can now be run again and again via Data - Refresh Range.  
To do this, the cursor must be within the source range.  
Data range  
Displays a reference to the data range in the sheet which is to be filtered.  
If you are working with a named range, its name will appear here as well.  
Special Filter  
Use this dialog to define a special filter.  
A special filter lets you combine up to eight different filter criteria.  
Read filter criteria from  
Choose from the list box the range name in the sheet containing the necessary filter criteria.

Error Codes in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
This describes %PRODUCTNAME error codes.  
In addition to the error message, the cleartext and a short description of the error will appear.  
The error code will be displayed along with the note Err:.  
If the cell with the error is active, the cleartext for the error will appear on the Status Bar.  
Error Code

Explanation  
501  
Invalid character  
The error is a character that is invalid in this context, e.g. =1Eq instead of =1E2.  
502  
Invalid argument  
A function argument has an invalid value, e.g. a negative number for the root function.

Interpreter: in the formula, a cell is referenced whose column, row or table was deleted.  
525  
invalid names (instead of Err:525 cell contains #NAME?)  
An identifier could not be evaluated (e.g., no valid reference, no valid domain name, no column/row label, no macro, incorrect decimal divider, add-in not found).  
526  
Internal syntax error  
Obsolete, no longer used, but could come from old documents if the result was a formula from a domain  
527  
Internal overflow  
Interpreter: references too encapsulated (cell references cell, the cell references, the cell references,...)  
Recognizing Names as Addressing  
%PRODUCTNAME can correlate names with areas for the most part automatically, as long as you have entered the row and column coordinates.  
Refer to the following illustration.  
The automatic formula recognition allows you to enter, for example, the formula =SUM(July) in cell B8.  
Cell C8 automatically shows the formula =SUM(August), cell D8 =SUM(September), and so on.  
This feature also works for horizontal calculations.  
Try it out by entering the formula =SUM(London) in cell E4.  
Because this name contains a space, it must be enclosed in single quotation marks: =SUM('New York ').  
Automatic recognition does not work with formulas.  
Instead you must enter =SUM(B8:D8) or =SUM(E3:E6).  
The latter formula will also be inserted automatically if you place the cursor in cell E8 and click the Sum icon in the Formula bar.  
This function is active by default.  
If you want, you can turn it off under Tools - Options... - Spreadsheet Document - Calculate.  
Remove the check in the check box in front of Automatically find column and row labels.  
You can also define the names yourself with Insert - Names - Labels....  
To have names automatically recognized, the names must consist of alphanumeric characters and the first character must be a letter.  
If you want to use non-alphanumeric characters (including spaces), enclose the names in single quotation marks (').  
If a single quotation mark appears in a name, e.g., Jan '97, you have to enter a backslash in front of the quotation mark (Jan \'97).  
This type of referencing is not compatible with earlier versions of %PRODUCTNAME.  
Addressing by Name  
A neat way of making the references to cells and cell ranges in formulas legible is to give the ranges names.  
You can, for example, name the range A1:B2 Start.  
Following the insertion or deletion of rows and columns %PRODUCTNAME also correctly assigns the ranges identified by name.  
Range names should not contain any spaces.  
For example, it is much easier to read a formula for sales tax if you can write "= Amount * Tax_rate" instead of "= A5 * B12".  
In this case, you would name cell A5 "Amount" and cell B12 "Tax_rate."  
Enter the name for the first area and click Add.  
You can also name other cell ranges in this dialog by entering the desired name in the field and then selecting the respective cells.  
Use the Define Names dialog to define names for formulas or parts of formulas you need more often.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
Inserting Sheets  
1.  
Point the mouse to the sheet tab at the bottom of the window.  
2.  
You will see commands for editing the sheets.  
3.  
You will see the Insert sheet dialog.  
4.  
Select the position and quantity of sheets to be inserted and click OK.  
Insert sheet dialog  
Auto Filling Cells  
If you mark a cell range and then click the small box in the bottom right-hand corner with the mouse and drag it down or to the right, the contents of the cells are automatically filled.  
The sequence 1, 2 becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the sequence 1, 3 becomes 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., the cell content "Quarter 1" becomes Quarter 1, Quarter 2, Quarter 3, etc., the cell content "Department 1" becomes Department 1, Department 2, Department 3, and so forth.  
Numbers are modified but not text.  
An exception is text that is entered in a sorted list (Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - Sort Lists).  
For example, when you drag open the sequence Jan Feb, it will continue with the abbreviations of the names of the month.  
If you just want to to copy the area without the values being changed, hold down the (Command) (Ctrl) key while dragging.  
In a spreadsheet document, how does one automatically advance a specific date field by one month in a column?  
Enter 01.01.00 in cell A1  
Enter 01.02.00 in cell A2.  
Select the two fields using the mouse (so that both are field shaded).  
In the lower right-hand corner of cell A2 you will see a small square.  
Place the mouse cursor on this square, until it turns into a target cross.  
Now drag the mouse down (so that several fields in the column are selected).  
If you now release the mouse button, the fields in the column will be filled with the date, advanced by one month in each case.  
Applying AutoFilter  
The AutoFilter function creates list boxes for the column headers, from which you can select the records to be displayed.  
Select the sheet area you want to filter.  
Start the Data - Filter - AutoFilter command.  
The list boxes are visible in the first row of the range selected.  
Select a value from a list box.  
Only those rows whose contents meet the filter criteria are displayed.  
The other rows are hidden.  
You can see if rows have been hidden from the discontinuous row numbers.  
The column that has been used for the filter is identified by a different color for the arrow button.  
In the AutoFilter list box of a cell select the -all- entry; all lines are shown again.  
To remove the list boxes reselect all cells selected in step 1 and once again start the Data - Filter - AutoFilter command.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc the arithmetic functions also take account of the hidden cells.  
For example, a sum of an entire column will also total the values in the hidden cells.  
Apply the SUBTOTAL function if only the cells visible after the application of a filter are to be taken into account.  
Data - Filter - AutoFilter  
SUBTOTAL  
Using AutoFormat for Tables  
A quick way to format a table or a cell range is offered by the Format - AutoFormat function.  
In your spreadsheet first select the cells to which you want to apply AutoFormatting, including the column and row headers and any sum rows or columns.  
At least 3x3 cells must be marked before this menu item is activated.  
Then start the AutoFormat dialog.  
The preview shows an example of how each format you select in the Format field will look.  
Click OK to apply the format to the selected range in the spreadsheet.  
If you do not see any change in color of the cell contents, then under Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View - Show or in the View menu, you may still have Highlight values marked.  
In this case the specified colors will be used.  
A format that you define yourself can be set as an AutoFormat:  
Format a spreadsheet to your liking.  
Select the whole sheet, e.g. by clicking the empty button in the top left corner (above the first row header).  
Call up the AutoFormat dialog and click Add....  
A dialog will appear in which you give the new format a name.  
The format defined in this way can then be used in the future on other spreadsheets.  
By choosing an appropriate background color and a pattern for the cells in the sheet, you can create an appealing spreadsheet.  
In the additional section that is then displayed, you can choose which properties of the chosen format are to be excluded from the automatic formatting.  
For example, if you remove the checkmark in front of Font, the font will not be taken into account by the AutoFormat.  
Format - AutoFormat  
Deactivating Automatic Changes  
As a default %PRODUCTNAME Calc corrects a large number of frequent typing errors.  
You can immediately undo any automatic changes, for example with Command Ctrl +Z.  
The following shows you where to deactivate (and reactivate) the automatic changes in %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Automatic text or number completion  
When making an entry in a cell, %PRODUCTNAME Calc automatically suggests matching input found in the same column.  
This function is known as AutoInput.  
To turn the AutoInput on and off, set or remove the check mark in front of Tools - Cell Contents - AutoInput.  
Quotation marks replaced by custom quotes  
Open a spreadsheet.  
Choose Tools - AutoCorrect.  
Go to the Custom Quotes tab.  
Unmark Replace.  
Cell content always begins with uppercase  
Open a spreadsheet.  
Choose Tools - AutoCorrect.  
Go to the Options tab.  
Unmark Capitalize first letter of every sentence.  
Replace word with another word  
Open a text document.  
Choose Tools - AutoCorrect.  
Go to the Replace tab.  
Search for the word pair and delete it.

Tools - AutoCorrect  
Calculating With Dates and Times  
In spreadsheets you can do more than just display dates and times (both taken from the internal clock of your computer).  
You can also perform calculations with dates and times.  
For instance, to find out exactly how old you are in seconds or hours, follow these steps:  
Open a new spreadsheet.  
Enter your birthday in cell A1, e.g., "4/9/64".  
Enter the following formula in cell A3: =NOW()-A1  
After pressing the Enter key or clicking the Accept icon (the green check mark on the formula bar) you will see the result in date format.  
Since you would like to see the difference between two dates as a number of days, you have to format cell A3 as a number.  
Set the cursor in cell A3, right-click this cell (i.e. call its context menu) and choose Format Cells....  
On the Numbers tab, the Number category will appear already highlighted.  
The format is set to "General" and causes, among other things, the result of a calculation containing date entries to also be displayed as a date.  
If you want to make a number be displayed instead, set the number format to "-1,234" for example, and close the dialog with the OK button.  
You should now see in cell A3 the number of days between today's date and the specified date.  
Experiment with some additional formulas: in A4 enter =A3*24 to calculate the hours, in A5 enter =A4*60 for the minutes, and in A6 enter =A5*60 for seconds.  
Press the Enter key after each formula.  
The time since your date of birth will be calculated and displayed in the various units.  
The values are calculated as of the exact moment when you entered the last formula and pressed the Enter key.  
This value is not automatically updated, although "Now" continuously changes, of course.  
If it were, your computer would be solely occupied with updating the sheet.  
-  
Automatically Calculating Rows  
Enter a number in a cell.  
With the mouse drag the bottom right corner of the cell downwards.  
When you release the mouse button, the cells selected in this manner are filled with numbers.  
The number you entered is increased by 1 in each case.  
If you have selected two or more adjacent cells, that contain different numbers, and you drag these together, any recognizable arithmetic pattern of the numbers is continued.  
An example:  
If A1 contains the number 1 and A2 the number 3, then joint copying of the two cells by dragging downwards causes the progression to continue with 5, 7, 9, 11 and so on.  
First select the range in the table that you want to completely fill.  
In the dialog, which you can now open by choosing Edit - Fill - Row, select the type of progression.  
For example, select 2 as the starting value, 2 as the increment and geometric progression as the progression type.  
In this way you obtain a list of the powers of 2.  
As you can see in the dialog, you can also automatically fill in series of dates and times.  
For example, to insert the first date of each month of the year as row headers, proceed as follows:  
Enter a date, e.g., "1/1/99" into a cell (without the quotation marks).  
Select this cell and the 11 cells below it.  
Choose Edit - Fill - Series.  
In the dialog, select Date and Month.  
Click OK.  
The first date of each month automatically appears in the selected cells.  
Sort lists  
Calculating Time Differences  
If you want to calculate time differences, e.g. the time between 23:30 and 01:10 in the same night, use the following formula:  
=(B2<A2)+B2-A2  
The later time is B2 and the earlier time is A2.  
1 hour and 40 minutes.  
In the formula, an entire 24-hour day has a value of 1 and one hour has a value of 1/24.  
The logical value in parentheses is 0 or 1, corresponding to 0 or 24 hours.  
The result returned by the formula is automatically issued in time format due to the sequence of the operands.  
Calculating in Spreadsheets  
In the following we show you a simple example of the percentage calculation that you can perform in a spreadsheet:  
1.  
Position the cursor in cell A3.  
2.  
Enter the number 150 and press the Enter key.  
The cursor then moves down to cell A4.  
3.  
Enter the number 16 in cell A4.  
This time, however, press the Tab key instead of the Enter key.  
The cursor moves to the right to cell B4.  
4.  
Enter the following in cell B4:  
=A3 * A4 / 100  
If you start the input with an equals sign, you are thereby indicating that you want to enter a formula.  
You will see the formula in the input line of the formula bar.  
5.  
Press Enter to finish the formula.  
You will see the result of the calculation (16 percent of 150) in cell B4.  
6.  
Click on cell A3, enter 200, and press the Enter key.  
Notice that the calculation result is adjusted automatically.  
7.  
Click on cell B4, and then click at the end of the formula in the input line of the Formula bar.  
A blinking text cursor indicates that you can make a new entry.  
8.  
Add "+ A3" (without the quotation marks) to the formula and press the Enter key.  
The newly calculated value of the formula appears in cell B4: the previous 16 percent of A3 plus the contents of A3.  
Only Copy Visible Cells  
Now you want to copy only the visible cells.  
%PRODUCTNAME behaves differently depending on how you hid the invisible cells and what you intend to do with them.  
Method  
Result  
Cells were filtered out by way of AutoFilters, default filters or special filters.  
Copy the visible cells, for example, with copy and paste via the clipboard, with the middle mouse button or drag and drop while pressing the Ctrl key.  
Only the visible cells are copied.  
Cells were filtered out by way of AutoFilters, default filters or special filters.  
Move the visible cells, for example, by way of cut and paste via the clipboard or drag and drop without pressing an additional key.  
All cells, including the hidden ones, are moved.  
Cells were hidden manually by way of the Hide command in the context menu of the row or column headers, or through an outline.  
Copy or move the visible cells.  
All cells, including the hidden ones, are copied or moved.  
Protecting Cells from Changes  
Cell protection is activated for all cells as the default.  
It is, however, only effective if you protect the sheet or the document.  
1.  
If you have cells in the document that you do not want to protect, e.g. in which the user is to make entries, then select these cells and unprotect them.  
If you then protect the sheet or the document, all other rows are protected from changes.  
2.  
Select Format - Cell and click on the Cell Protection tab.  
The check boxes in this tab are tristate fields, capable of assuming three states.  
If the box is not checked, the option does not apply to any of the selected cells.  
A check mark indicates that the option is valid for all selected cells.  
If the check mark and box are gray, the option is valid for at least one cell but not for all.  
3.  
Select the protection options for the selected cells.  
Protected means that the contents of the cell and the cell format cannot be modified.  
Hide formulas makes the formulas invisible and protects them from changes.  
Hide for printing displays the protected cells on-screen, but not when printed.  
4.  
The selected cells will be marked, according to your choices, to be protected selectively or to be excluded from general protection.  
5.  
To activate the protection, select Tools - Protect Document and then Sheet or Document.  
A dialog box appears, where you can enter an optional password.  
The protection becomes active when you close the dialog with OK, even if you do not specify a password.  
If you enter a password and then later forget it, you will have no way to deactivate protection!  
If you merely want to protect the cells from inadvertent changes, it is better not to enter a password.  
Referencing Cells by Drag&Drop  
With the help of the Navigator you can reference cells from one spreadsheet in another sheet in the same document or in another document.  
The cells can be inserted as a copy, link or hyperlink.  
The range to be inserted must be defined in the original file with a name so that it can be inserted in the target file.  
Open the document that contains the source cells.  
The source range should be set as the range, e.g. by selecting the cells and the menu command Insert - Names - Define.  
If you have only now defined the range, save the source document again.  
In addition, open the sheet in which you want to insert something as the current sheet.  
In the lower combo box of the navigator select the source file.  
You will now see in the navigator the source file object and, inter alia, the ranges defined there.  
With the Drag mode icon in Navigator choose if you want the reference to be a hyperlink, link, or copy.  
Click the entry "Area names" in the Navigator, and drag the desired area into the cell of the active sheet where you want to insert the reference.  
This method can also be used to insert an area from a different sheet of the same document into the active sheet.  
References to Other Sheets  
In a sheet cell you can show a reference to a cell in another sheet.  
Open a new, empty spreadsheet.  
By way of example, enter in cell A1 of Sheet1 the following formula and complete the input with the Enter key:  
=Sheet2.A1  
If you now click the sheet tab with the label text Sheet2 on the bottom window border, you will go to Sheet2 of the current document.  
Set the cursor in cell A1 there and enter text or a number.  
If you switch back to Sheet1, you will see the same content in cell A1 there.  
If the contents of Sheet2.A1 change, then the contents of Sheet1.A1 also change.  
In a corresponding way a reference can also be made to a cell of another document.  
Open another spreadsheet in addition to your new spreadsheet, which is already saved as a file (this does not work unless a document has previously been saved).  
If you have installed the samples you can, for example, by choosing File - Open, open the Movie1 document from the spreadsheet samples.  
Set the cursor in a free cell and enter an equals sign to indicate that you want to begin a formula.  
Click cell C3.  
Switch back to the new spreadsheet.  
In the calculation row you will now see how %PRODUCTNAME Calc has added the reference to the formula for you.  
By way of example, the following will now be located there:  
='file:///C:/{installpath}/share/samples/english/spreadsheets/Movie1.sdc'#$movievisits.C3  
Confirm the formula by clicking the green check mark.  
The reference to a cell of another document thus contains the name of the other document in single inverted commas, then a hash #, then the name of the sheet in the other document followed by a point and the name of the cell there C3.  
The name of the sheet automatically receives a leading dollar sign, since the sheet has absolute addressing.  
If you closely examine the name of the other document in this formula, you will notice that it is written as a URL.  
This means that you can also enter a URL from the Internet.  
If, for example, you found an Internet page containing current stock exchange information in spreadsheet cells, you can load this page in %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Just follow these steps:  
In a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document, position the cursor in the cell starting from which you want to insert the external data.  
Choose Insert - External Data.  
The External Data dialog appears.  
In the dialog, enter the URL of the document or Web page.  
Write the URL in the following way: (fictional example) http://www.my-bank.com/table.html.  
You can enter a file name from the local or network file system in the usual way, i.e., like in the File - Open dialog.  
%PRODUCTNAME loads the Web page or file in the "background", that is, without displaying it.  
In the large list box of the External Data dialog, you can see the name of all the sheets or areas you can choose from.  
Select one or more sheets or areas, if you want, activate the automatic update function every n minutes and click OK.  
The contents will be inserted as a link in the %PRODUCTNAME Calc document.  
Save your spreadsheet.  
When you open it again later, %PRODUCTNAME Calc will update the linked cells following an inquiry.  
Under Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - General you can choose to have the update, when opened, automatically carried out either always, upon request or never.  
The update can be started manually in the dialog under Edit - Links.  
Referencing a Cell in Another Document  
You can also reference a cell in another spreadsheet:  
Open an existing spreadsheet, or insert some numbers and text in a new spreadsheet and save it on the hard disk.  
For this example, the document is named 'C:.sdc'; and the sheet that it contains is Sheet1.  
Open a new spreadsheet document.  
Place the cursor in cell A1 and enter the following formula: ='C:.sdc'#Sheet1.A1  
Alternatively, you could also enter the file name as a URL designation: ='file:///C_BAR_/test.sdc'#sdc#'Sheet1.A1.  
You can access a file in the Internet similarly: ='http://www.sun.com/test/test.sdc'#Sheet1.A1 (this is a fictional example).  
Now, drag the box in the lower right corner of the active cell to select a range of cells. %PRODUCTNAME automatically inserts the corresponding references in the adjacent cells.  
As a result, the sheet name is preceded with a "$" sign to designate it as an absolute reference.  
Assigning Formats by Formula  
The STYLE() function can be added to an existing formula in a cell.  
The formula =...+STYLE(IF(CURRENT()>3, "Red", "Green")) applies the cell style "Red" to cells if the value is greater than 3, otherwise the cell style "Green" is applied.  
If you would like to apply this formula to all cells in a selected area, you can use the Search & Replace dialog.  
Select all the desired cells.  
Select the menu command Edit - Search & Replace....  
For the Search term, enter: .*  
(.* is a regular expression that designates the contents of an active cell.)  
Enter the following formula in the Replace field: =&+STYLE(IF(CURRENT()>3;"Red";"Green "))  
(The & symbol designates the current contents of the Search field.  
The line must begin with an equal sign, since it is a formula.  
It is assumed that the cell styles "Red" and "Green" already exist.)  
Mark the fields Regular expression and Current selection only.  
Click Find all.  
All cells with contents that were included in the selection are now highlighted.  
Click Replace all.  
Applying Conditional Formatting  
Using the menu commands Format - Conditional formatting the dialog allows you to define up to three conditions per cell, which must be met in order for the selected cells to have a particular format.  
Using conditional formatting, you can, for example, highlight the totals that exceed the average value of all totals.  
If the totals change, the formatting changes correspondingly, without having to apply other styles manually.  
Select the cells to which you want to apply a conditional style.  
Select the command Format - Conditional Formatting.  
Enter the condition(s) into the dialog box.  
The dialog is described in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help, and an example is provided below:  
examples of conditional formatting: generate number values  
You want to give certain values in your tables particular emphasis, e.g. in a table of turnovers show all the values above the average in green and all those below the average in red.  
This is possible with conditional formatting.  
First of all write a table in which a few different values occur.  
For your test you can create tables with any random numbers:  
In one of the cells enter the formula =RAND(), and you will obtain a random number between 0 and 1.  
If you want integers of between 0 and 50, enter the formula =INTEGER(RAND()*50).  
Now, copy the formula to create a row of random numbers.  
Click the bottom right corner of the selected cell, and drag to the right until the desired cell range is selected.  
In the same way as described above drag the corner of the cell fully to the bottom right in order to create more rows of random numbers.  
Define cell styles  
In our example you now apply two cell styles for your numbers: one style for all values that represent above-average turnover, and one for those that are below the average.  
The Stylist should be visible.  
Click in a blank cell and select the command Format Cells in the context menu.  
In the Cell Attributes dialog, select a background color on the Background tabpage.  
Click OK.  
In Stylists click the New style from selection icon.  
In the dialog enter as the name of the new style, for example, "Above".  
To define a second style, click again in a blank cell and proceed as described above.  
Assign a different background color for the cell and a name (e.g., "Below").  
Example of conditional formatting:  
Calculate mean  
In our particular example we are calculating the average of the random values.  
The result is placed in a cell:  
Set the cursor in a blank cell, e.g., J14, and activate the Function Autopilot.  
Select the MEAN function.  
Use the mouse to select all your random numbers.  
Functions is obscuring it, you can temporarily zoom out from the dialog using the Zoom in/out key.  
Functions with OK.  
Apply cell  
Now you can apply the conditional formatting to the sheet:  
Select all cells with the random numbers.  
Select the Format - Conditional Formatting... command to open the corresponding dialog.  
Define the condition as follows:  
If cell value is less than J14, format with cell style "Below", and if cell value is greater than or equal to J14, format with cell style "Above".  
examples of conditional formatting: copy cell style  
To apply the conditional formatting to other cells later:  
Click one of the cells that has been assigned conditional formatting.  
Copy the cell to the clipboard, e.g. using (Command) (Ctrl) (C).  
Select the cells that are to receive this same formatting.  
Start the Edit - Content - Paste special command.  
You will see the Paste special dialog.  
If in the Selection area you only mark the Format, field the other markings are undone.  
Click OK.  
Format - Conditional formatting  
Highlighting Negative Numbers  
Alternatively you can define your own number format, in which negative numbers are highlighted in other colors.  
Select the cells and start the Format - Cell command.  
On the tabpage Numbers, choose a number format and select the option Negative numbers red.  
Click OK.  
The cell number format is defined in two parts.  
The format for positive numbers and zero is defined in front of the semicolon, and after the semicolon is the formula for negative numbers.  
You can change the code (RED) under Format Code.  
Instead of "RED," enter "YELLOW," for example.  
If the new code appears in the list after clicking the Add icon, this is a valid entry.  
Applying Cell Styles  
Open a new, empty spreadsheet.  
Place the cursor in cell A1 and insert some text.  
Place the cursor in A2 and insert a number.  
Format the number as the result by assigning it the "Result" cell style.  
To do this you can set the cursor in the cell, show the Stylists (F11), then double click the "Results" entry.  
Format the text as a heading, for example, in bold 20 point font size, with blue lettering against a yellow background.  
Place the cursor in A1 and apply the desired attributes with the icons and list boxes on the text object bar.  
Alternatively, you can select the whole text in the cell, call the context menu of the selected text and choose the Character command.  
Define this new format as a new Style.  
In the Stylist click the New Style by Example icon to open a dialog in which you can assign a name for the style.  
Name the cell style "Title Format," for example.  
Click OK.  
The new cell style should appear in the Stylist.  
In order to assign the cells the new title format, select the cells and double click in Stylists on the name of the cell style.  
Unprotecting Cells  
Click the sheet for which you want to cancel the protection.  
Select Tools - Protect Document, then choose Sheet or Document to remove the check mark indicating the protected status.  
If you have assigned a password, enter it in this dialog and click OK.  
The cells can now be edited, the formulas can be viewed, and all cells can be printed until you reactivate the protection for the sheet or document.  
Consolidating Data  
During consolidation, the contents of the cells from several sheets will be combined in one place.  
Choose a function so that you can, for example, see the sum, the standard deviation or the variance of the data.  
1.  
Go to the document that contains the areas to be consolidated.  
2.  
Choose Data - Consolidate to open the Consolidate dialog.  
3.  
From the Source Data Area list box, select an area as a starting point to consolidate with other areas.  
4.  
If the area is not named, click in the field next to the Source Data Area.  
A blinking text cursor appears.  
Type a reference for the first source data area or select the area in the sheet with the mouse.  
5.  
Click Add to insert the selected area as a Consolidation Area.  
6.  
Select additional areas and click Add after each selection.  
7.  
Specify where you want to display the result by selecting a target area from the Copy results to list box.  
8.  
If the target area is not named, click in the field next to Copy results to and enter the reference of the target area (or the top left cell in the target area).  
Alternatively, you can select the area using the mouse or simply position the cursor in the top left cell of the target area.  
9.  
Select a calculation rule for determining how the values of the consolidation areas should be linked.  
The sum function is the default setting.  
10.  
Click OK to consolidate the area.  
If you do not want to create a new sheet independent from the source areas, but would prefer to retain links to the source areas, or if you want to consolidate areas in which the order of rows or columns varies, click the More button in the Consolidate dialog.  
Select Link to Source Data to insert only the formulas that generate the results in the target area, rather than the actual results.  
If you link the data, any values modified in the source area are automatically updated in the target area.  
Only the final result, based on the selected calculation rule, is displayed.  
Under Consolidate by, select either Row Labels or Column Headers if the cells of the source area are not to be consolidated corresponding to the identical position of the cell in the area, but instead according to a matching row label or column header.  
To consolidate by row or column headers, the text must be contained in the selected source areas, or included in the selection with the mouse.  
The text in the headers or labels must be identical, so that rows or columns can be accurately matched.  
If the row or column label does not match any that exist in the target area, it will be appended as a new row or column.  
The data from the consolidation and target areas will be saved when you save the document.  
If you later open a document in which consolidation has been defined, this data will again be available.  
Data - Consolidate  
Formulas and Values as CSV File  
Csv-files are pure text files, which contain the contents of the cells of a table.  
Commas or semicolons, for example, are used as the field delimiters between the cells.  
Texts are automatically put in quotation marks, numbers are written directly.  
Exporting Formulas and Values as CSV Files  
Go to the table that is to be written as a csv file.  
If you want to export the formulas as formulas, e.g. in the form =SUM(A1:B5), proceed as follows:  
Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View.  
Under Display, mark the Formulas field.  
Click OK.  
If instead of the formulas you want to export the calculation results, do not mark Formulas.  
Choose File - Save as.  
You will see the Save as dialog.  
In the File type field select the format "Text CSV".  
Enter a name and click Save.  
From the Export Text dialog that appears, select the records and the field and text delimiters for the data to be exported and confirm with OK.  
Caution:  
If the numbers contain commas as the decimal separator or thousands separator, you should not select the comma as the field delimiter.  
If the text contains double quotation marks, you must select the single quotation mark as separator and vice versa.  
If necessary, after you have saved, unmark Formulas to see the calculated results in the table again.  
Importing a CSV File  
Choose File - Open.  
You will see the Open dialog.  
In the File type field, select the format "Text CSV".  
Select the file and click Open.  
When a file has the .csv extension, the file type is automatically recognized.  
You will see the Import text files dialog.  
Click OK.  
If the csv file contains formulas as formulas, unmark Formulas (in Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View), so that you see the calculated results in the table.  
Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View

Import text files  
Cells in the Currency Format  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc you can give the numbers any currency format.  
When you click the Currency icon in the object list to format a number, the cell is given the default currency format set in %PRODUCTNAME under Tools - Options - Language Settings - Languages.  
Without currency formats, the international exchange of %PRODUCTNAME Calc documents could lead to misunderstandings.  
Imagine that your %PRODUCTNAME Calc document is loaded by a user who uses a different default currency format.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc you can define that a number that you have formatted as "1,234.50", still remains in euro in another country and does not become dollars, for example.  
You can influence the currency format in the Cell Attributes dialog (Choose Format - Cells - Numbers tab) by two country settings.  
In the Language list box select the basic setting for currency symbol, decimal and thousands separators.  
In the Format list box select any deviations from the currency symbol of the format defined by the language.  
If, for example, the language is set to "Default" and you are using a German locale setting, the currency format will be "1.234,00".  
A point is used before the thousand digits and a comma before the decimal places.  
If you now select in the Format list box the subordinate currency format "$English (US)", you will get the following format: "$1.234,00".  
As you can see, the separators have remained the same.  
Only the currency symbol has been changed and converted, but the underlying Format of the notation remains the same as it is set in the locale setting.  
If from the start in Language you convert the cells to "English (US)", the English-language locale setting is also transferred and the default currency format is now "$1,234.00".  
You can also make a change here so that the format is like "1,234.00".  
This notation is more familiar to people in English-speaking countries.  
Format - Cell - Numbers  
Defining Database Ranges  
For example, if you would like to manage your household budget with %PRODUCTNAME Calc, enter the records in an empty %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet and select the area as a database range.  
Creating Records in a Spreadsheet  
Open a new spreadsheet.  
Then enter some information.  
To format your sheet as in the illustration, proceed as follows:  
1.  
Select row 1 by clicking on the row header.  
Click the Bold icon.  
2.  
Select the entire column A by clicking on the column header.  
Open the context menu and choose Format Cells.  
In the Cell Attributes dialog, click the Numbers tab and choose a date format for Column A.  
3.  
Select column C by clicking on the column header, and apply a currency format.  
You only need to click the Number Format: Currency  
Defining Database Ranges  
Select the three column area and define the selected area as a database range by choosing Data - Define Range.  
The selected range already appears in the Define Database Range dialog.  
Be sure to mark the check box Contains column headers so that the first row is correctly taken into account.  
This box becomes visible when you click the More button.  
Enter a name for the range and close the dialog with OK.  
The selected range is now defined as a database range, which among other things, means that the rows (records) can be conveniently sorted.  
Sort lists and filters you have defined for the database range will be updated.  
Filtering Database Ranges  
To filter out only certain records so that you can modify them, use the spreadsheet filtering function.  
You can choose between using a dialog to specify the criteria exactly (in that case range definitions are also possible), or creating an AutoFilter that will help whenever you want to filter according to specific values or text.  
Imagine that the output list is already 8000 records long.  
You can no longer get an overview.  
Now you want to see only those records that occurred after 1/2/2000 and which apart from this involve an amount in excess of 100 currency units.  
Set the cursor in the database range and choose Data - Filter - Standard Filter to open the dialog.  
Enter the following:  
Date > 1/2/2000 AND Amount > 100.  
In the dialog, you can select the existing contents of the data fields in the combo boxes, but you can also enter the amount 100 directly.  
If you click OK, you will now only see the records that meet all criteria.  
Choose Data - Filter - Remove Filter to reset the view.  
To display only records with a specific content, you can easily do this with the aid of the AutoFilter.  
Place the cursor in the database range.  
Click on the AutoFilter icon on the main toolbar.  
The column headers of the database range have now been given small buttons.  
Click on the button next to the Date field and select for example, 1/2/00.  
Only records that contain this date will be shown.  
On the main toolbar, reset the view with the AutoFilter icon.  
Grouping Database Ranges and Calculating Subtotals  
If you want to expand the sample data and actually use it for a budget, you will also want to summarize and print the data in totals and subtotals.  
This can be done in just a few steps.  
Place the cursor in the database range.  
Choose Data - Subtotals.  
The Subtotals dialog appears.  
Specify the desired options for calculating the subtotals.  
Group subtotals according to "Date" (i.e. calculates a new subtotal for each date), and use the function "Sum" (adds the subtotals) to calculate "Amount."  
As soon as you press Enter or click OK, the sheet will be grouped according to the subtotals.  
For every group of entries with an identical date, a subtotal is calculated.  
The grand total is displayed at the bottom.  
Notice the controls to the left of the row headers.  
They enable you to view which records (rows) have been summarized.  
If you click on a minus sign, only the row with the results is shown.  
The easiest way to control the display is with the small digits above the group area.  
If you click on 1, only the grand total is displayed; 2 reveals the subtotals, and 3 shows all elements.  
Sorting Database Ranges  
You have selected a range of cells and defined these as a database range by choosing Data - Define Range.  
Set the cursor in the database range and choose Data - Sort.  
In the dialog that appears, select the column to be sorted, e.g. "Amount", as the sort criterion and click OK.  
For instance, you can sort the expenditures first by date, then by item if they have the same date, and then by amount if they have the same date and item.  
Creating DataPilot Tables  
Select the data range of a table together with the row and column headings.  
Choose Data - DataPilot - Start.  
The dialog Select Source appears.  
Select the option Current selection and confirm with OK.  
The column headings of the table will be shown as buttons in the DataPilot dialog, which can then be positioned via drag and drop as required in the layout areas "Column", "Row" and "Data".  
Drag the required fields into one of the three areas.  
The field will be dropped accordingly.  
If the button is dropped in the Data area it will be given a caption that also shows the formula that will be used in the data range to create the data.  
By double-clicking on one of the fields in the Data area you can call up the Data Field dialog.  
Use this dialog to select the functions to be used for displaying the data in the data area.  
To make a multiple selection, press the Ctrl key while clicking the functions.  
The order of the buttons can be changed at any time by simply moving them to a different position in the area with the mouse.  
Replace a button by dragging it to the other buttons.  
When you double-click one of the buttons in the Row or Column area, you will see the Data Field dialog.  
This is where you can select if and to what extent %PRODUCTNAME should calculate and display subtotals.  
Exit the DataPilot by pressing OK.  
A Filter button will now be inserted into the table - the default position is under the selected area, two lines further down the DataPilot table is inserted.  
It has a bold outline.  
Deleting DataPilot Tables  
In order to delete a DataPilot table, select any cell in the analysis table, then choose Data - DataPilot - Delete.  
Editing DataPilot Tables  
Click one of the buttons in the table that the DataPilot has created and hold the mouse button down.  
A special symbol will appear next to the mouse pointer.  
By dragging the button to a different position in the row you can alter the order of the columns.  
If you drag a button from the row to the left edge of the table into the line headings area, you can change a column into a row.  
The mouse pointer alters its appearance from the icon for a column heading to that of a line heading.  
To remove a button from the table, just drag it out of the table.  
Release the mouse button when the mouse pointer positioned within the sheet has become a 'not allowed' icon.  
The button is deleted.  
By double-clicking on the name of a table element you can hide or show the merged elements below it.  
Filtering DataPilot Tables  
Although the DataPilot tables have usually been created according to the user's requirements, there may be occasions when not all of the data provided by the tables is of interest.  
If this should be the case, filters are used whereby conditions are applied to the data and if they are not met the excess data will be removed from the tables.  
Click the Filter button in the sheet to call up the entry mask for the filter conditions.  
The Filter dialog will appear.  
This dialog provides different criteria which can be used for selecting data.  
Selecting DataPilot Output Ranges  
Click the button More in the DataPilot dialog.  
The dialog will be extended.  
You can select a named area in which the DataPilot table is to be created, from the list box Results to.  
If the required output area does not have a name, enter the coordinates of the upper left cell of the area into the field to the right of the list box Results to.  
You can also click on the appropriate cell with the mouse to have the coordinates entered accordingly.  
If you activate the check box Ignore empty rows, they will not be taken into account when the DataPilot table is created.  
If the check box Identify categories is activated, the categories will be recognized by means of their headings and assigned accordingly when the DataPilot table is created.  
Updating DataPilot Tables  
If the data of the basis table has been changed, %PRODUCTNAME will have to recalculate the tables to bring the analysis up-to-date.  
To recalculate the tables, click while holding down the Ctrl key with the right mouse button on one of the button fields and choose the Refresh entry or choose Data - DataPilot - Refresh.  
DataPilot  
The DataPilot allows you to analyze and assess data that has already been entered.  
It allows you, from one and the same value, to generate reports as a function of the point of view that is most prominent.  
Imagine a data analysis table containing your company's sales figures, not only for specific product groups, but also for branches and years.  
Use the DataPilot to quickly find the data you are interested in.  
What do you need the DataPilot for?  
A table that has been created with the DataPilot is an interactive table, i.e. data can be arranged, rearranged or summarized according to different points of view.  
This functionality is especially useful for Sales Controlling.  
On the one hand it may be important to view the turnover figures at regular intervals, on the other it may be relevant to analyze sales figures on a regional basis.  
Theme Selection for Sheets  
Open one of the %PRODUCTNAME sample documents by choosing Samples - Spreadsheets.  
These sample spreadsheets have been created using user-defined Styles.  
You can open the Stylist and in its lower list box set the Custom Styles view.  
A list of the existing custom defined cell styles will be displayed.  
As soon as you select another theme in the Theme Selection dialog, some of the properties of the custom style will be applied to the current spreadsheet.  
The modifications will be immediately visible in your spreadsheet.  
You can apply the custom styles in a new spreadsheet document by simply calling the Theme Selection dialog.  
This dialog lists the available themes for the whole spreadsheet and the stylist lists the custom styles for specific cells.  
Double click a name from the Stylist to apply this style to the selected cells.  
Theme selection  
Copying Multiple Sheets  
You want to enter new identical column and row titles for all three sheets.  
Select all three sheets by holding down the shift key and clicking all the register tabs that are still gray at the bottom margin of the workspace.  
All three register tabs are now white.  
Now when you insert values, text or formulas into the sheets, they will also appear in the identical positions in the other selected sheets.  
Converting Euro Amounts by Formulas  
If you want to convert a sum of $100 into euros, you can write the following formula in a cell:  
=CONVERT(100;"USD";"EUR ")  
The result you obtain will be the number of Euros for 100 US dollars.  
The sum to be converted is always stated first within the parentheses.  
It can be entered directly, as here, or as a reference.  
If the amount is, for example, in cell D2, you can enter D2 in the formula as the first part of the function.  
The other parts of the function name the unit of the amount and the unit into which it is to be converted.  
All three parts of the function are separated from each other by semicolons.  
Using the formula =CONVERT(50;"EUR";"USD ") you will obtain the number of US dollars for 50 Euros.  
If in column D, from D2 to D20 you have a number of USD sums and in column E from E2 to E20 you want the same sums in Euros, proceed as follows:  
Click in cell E2.  
Enter the following: =CONVERT(  
Click in cell D2.  
D2 is now defined as the first part of the function.  
The cursor remains at D2 in the formula.  
Enter the following text: ;"USD";"EUR "  
(enter the text with both semicolons and the quotation marks) and press the Enter key.  
This completes the entire formula which now reads =CONVERT(D2;"USD";"EUR ").  
Cell E2 now contains the result of the calculation.  
Click cell E2, then the small filled square in the bottom right hand corner of cell E2 and, pressing the mouse button, drag down to cell E20.  
Release the mouse button there.  
You have now copied the formula from E2 to E20.  
The references have been automatically adapted so that they always refer to the neighboring cell on the left.  
Euro-Converter  
Applying Filter  
Filters and advanced filters allow you to ensure that only certain rows = records of a data range are visible.  
In the spreadsheets in %PRODUCTNAME there are various possibilities for applying filters.  
One use for the AutoFilter function is to quickly restrict the display to records with identical entries in a data field.  
In the Filter dialog, you can also define ranges which contain the values in particular data fields.  
You can use the standard filter to connect up to three conditions with either a logical AND or a logical OR operator.  
The Advanced filter ultimately exceeds this limitation of three conditions and allows up to a total of eight filter conditions.  
With advanced filters you enter the conditions directly into the sheet.  
if you select rows for filters and then want to delete these, before deleting you must first click all the rows visible after the filter individually while pressing the (Ctrl)-key.  
This ensures that only these rows are selected and only these are then deleted.  
Designing Spreadsheets Clearly  
%PRODUCTNAME helps you design your sheet in a variety of ways.  
For example, here are three different views of the same sheet, varying only in layout:  
This is a sample sheet without any special formatting, as it appears by default.  
If you simply format the sheet with one of the AutoFormats, it will look appealing without requiring any further editing on your part.  
Here the example sheet has been formatted with certain cell attributes in the Format - Cells dialog.  
In addition the view of the gridlines and sheet headers has been deactivated in Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View and a graphics file loaded as background in Format - Page - Background.  
An image that you load via Format - Page - Background, is only visible in print or via File - Page View.  
If you want to have a background image on screen as well, insert the graphic image by choosing Insert - Graphics - From File and put the image behind the cells by way of the context menu command Arrangement - To the Background.  
To later select the background image, use the Navigator.  
Formatting Text in a Spreadsheet  
Select the text you want to format.  
You can also choose Format - Cells.  
The Cell Attributes dialog will appear in which you can choose various text attributes on the Font tab page.  
Formatting Numbers in a Spreadsheet  
Select the cells containing the numbers you want to format.  
To format numbers in the default currency format or as percentages, use the icons on the spreadsheet object bar.  
For other formats, choose Format - Cells....  
You can choose from the preset formats or define your own on the Numbers tab page.  
Formatting Borders and Backgrounds for Cells and Pages  
Basically, you can assign a format to any group of cells by first selecting the cells (for multiple selection, hold down the Command Ctrl key when clicking), and then activating the Cell Attributes dialog via Format - Cell.  
In this dialog, you can select attributes such as shadows and backgrounds.  
To apply formatting attributes to an entire sheet, choose Format - Page.  
You can define headers and footers, for example, to appear on each printed page.  
Formating Numbers  
Enter a number into the sheet, for example, 1234.5678.  
You will see 1234.57 when you confirm the entry.  
Only the display in the document will be rounded off; internally, the number retains all four decimal places after the decimal point.  
Set the cursor at the number and choose Format - Cells to start the Cell Attributes dialog.  
On the Numbers tab you will see a selection of predefined number formats.  
In the bottom right in the dialog you will see a preview of how your current number would look if you were to give it a particular format.  
In this dialog, you can define other attributes (in addition to number formats) which apply to the selected cells or cell contents.  
On the Font tab page, for example, you can define a font, size, and color.  
If you only want to modify the number of the decimal places displayed, the easiest method is to use the Number Format: Add Decimal Place  
Copying Formulas  
One suggested method is:  
Select the cell containing the formula.  
Choose Edit - Copy, or press Command Ctrl + C to copy it.  
Select the cell into which you want the formula to be copied.  
Choose Edit - Paste, or press Command Ctrl +V.  
The formula will be positioned in the new cell.  
If you want to copy a formula into multiple cells, there iss a quick and easy way to copy into adjacent cell areas:  
Select the cell containing the formula.  
Position the mouse on the bottom right of the highlighted border of the cell, and continue holding down the mouse button until the pointer changes to a cross-hair symbol.  
With the mouse button pressed, drag it down or to the right over all the cells into which you want to copy the formula.  
When you release the mouse button, the formula will be copied into the cells and automatically adjusted.  
If you do not want values and texts to be automatically adjusted, then hold down the Command Ctrl key when dragging.  
Formulas, however, are always adjusted accordingly.  
Inputting Formulas in Formula Bar  
Click the cell in which you want to enter the formula.  
Click the Function icon on the formula bar.  
You will now see an equals sign in the input line and you can begin to input the formula.  
After entering the required values, press Enter or click Accept to insert the result in the active cell.  
If you want to clear your entry in the Input line, press (Esc) or click Cancel.  
Of course, you can also enter the values and the formulas directly in the cells even if you cannot see an input cursor.  
Formulas must always begin with an equals sign.  
If you are editing a formula with references, the references will be highlighted together in the formula and the associated cells in the sheet in the same color.  
You can now, for example, drag the reference border using the mouse to another size and the reference in the formula in the input line is also changed.  
Show references in color can be deactivated under Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View.  
If you would like to view the calculation of individual elements of a formula, select the respective elements and press (F9).  
For example, in the formula =SUM(A1:B12)*SUM(C1:D12) select the section SUM(C1:D12) and press (F9) to view the subtotal for this area.  
If an error occurs when creating the formula, an error message appears in the active cell.  
Formula bar  
Calculating With Formulas  
All formulas begin with an equals sign.  
The formulas may contain numbers or text, and other data is also possible such as format details, that specify how the numbers are to be formatted.  
Naturally the formulas will also contain arithmetic operators, logic operators or function starts.  
Remember that the basic arithmetic signs (+, -, *, /) can be used in formulas using the "Multiplication and Division before Addition and Subtraction" rule.  
Instead of writing =SUM(A1:B1) it's better to write =A1+B1.  
Parentheses are also possible.  
The result of the formula =1+2*3 means something different than =(1+2)*3.  
Here are a few examples of %PRODUCTNAME Calc formulas:  
=A1+10  
Displays the contents of cell A1 plus 10.  
=A1*16%  
Displays 16% of the contents of A1.  
=A1 * A2  
Displays the result of the multiplication of A1 and A2.  
=ROUND(A1;1)  
Rounds the contents in cell A1 to one decimal place.  
=EFFECTIVE(5%;12)  
Calculates the effective interest at 5% annually with 12 payments.  
=B8-SUM(B10:B14)  
Calculates the sum of the cells B10 to B14 minus the value of B8.  
=SUM(B8;SUM(B10:B14))  
Calculates the sum of cells B10 to B14 and adds the value to B8.  
It is also possible to nest functions in formulas, as shown in the example.  
For example, instead of =ROUND(A1;1), you could also calculate the sine function with =ROUND(SIN(A1);2).  
The Function AutoPilot assists you with nested functions.

Displaying Formulas or Values  
If you want to display the formulas in the cells, e.g. in the form =SUM(A1:B5), proceed as follows:  
Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View.  
In the Display area mark the Formulas box.  
Click OK.  
If instead of the formulas you want to see the calculation results, do not mark the Formulas box.

Entering Fractions  
You can also enter a fractional number in a cell and use it for calculation:  
Enter "0 1/5" in a cell (without the quotation marks) and press the input key.  
In the input line you will see the value 0.2 which will be used for the calculation.  
If you enter "0 1/2" AutoCorrect causes the three characters 1, / and 2 to be replaced by a single character.  
The same applies to 1/4 and 3/4.  
This replacement is defined in Tools - AutoCorrect Replace tab.  
If you want to see multidigit fractions such as "1/10", you must change the cell format to the multidigit fraction view (Context menu of the Cell, choose Format cells).  
You can then enter fractions such as 12/31 or 12/32 - the fractions are however automatically reduced, so that in the last example you would see 3/8.  
Applying Goal Seek  
With the help of Goal Seek you can calculate a value that, as part of a formula, leads to the result you specify for the formula.  
You thus define the formula with several fixed values and one variable value and the result of the formula.  
Goal Seek is best illustrated by means of an example.  
To calculate annual interest, create a table with the values for the capital (C), number of years (n), and interest rate (i).  
The formula is:  
I = C * n* i / 100  
You can also enter the formula using the variable names:  
Interest = Capital * Year * Interest rate / 100.  
A5 and E5 as currency, and C5 as percent.  
The cell width is adjusted automatically.)  
We recommend that you assign names to cells so that you can use these names in the formula.  
Naming Cells  
Select cell A5 in our example, then choose Insert - Names - Define.  
The Define Names dialog appears.  
Enter the name "C" in the text field.  
At the bottom of the dialog, you will see the reference: $Sheet1.$A$5.  
Double-check for accuracy, then click Add.  
In the next field, enter an "i," place the cursor in cell B5, and again click Add.  
Next, enter an "n" in the empty field, place the cursor in cell C5, and click once more on Add.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
You can now enter the formula in E5 using the variables = C*n*i instead of = A5*B5*C5.  
Start Goal Seek  
However, you may want to know how much the investment would have to be modified in order to attain a particular annual return.  
For this example, calculate how much capital would be required if you want an annual return of $15,000.  
Place the cursor in cell E5, and choose Tools - Goal Seek.  
The Goal Seek dialog appears.  
The correct cell is already entered in the field Formula Cell.  
Place the cursor in the field Variable Cell.  
In the sheet, click in the cell (A5) that contains the value to be changed.  
In this example, the value is 15,000.  
Click OK.  
A dialog appears informing you that the Goal Seek was successful.  
The result is indicated for you to use if you want to.  
Click Yes to enter the result in cell A5.

Saving and Opening Sheets in HTML  
Saving Sheets in HTML  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc saves all the sheets of a Calc document together as an HTML document.  
At the start of the HTML document a heading and a list of hyperlinks are automatically added which lead to the individual sheets within the document.  
Numbers are shown as written.  
In addition, in the<SDVAL> HTML tag theexact internal number value is written so that after opening the HTMLdocument with %PRODUCTNAMEyou know you have the exact values.  
To save the current Calc document as HTML, choose File - Save As.  
In the area with the other %PRODUCTNAME Calc filters, choose the File type "Web Page".  
Enter a File name and click Save.  
Opening Sheets in HTML  
HTML documents are always opened with write-protection on.  
To edit an opened HTML document, click the Edit File icon on the function bar.  
%PRODUCTNAME offers various filters for opening HTML files, which you can select under File - Open (dialog appears) in the File type field (pay attention to the area, as the name "Web page" is always the same):  
Open in %PRODUCTNAME Writer/Web filter "Web page" or as default, do not select a filter.

Entering a Number with Leading Zeros  
There are various ways to enter integers starting with a zero:  
Enter the number as text.  
The easiest way is to enter the number starting with an apostrophe (for example, '0987).  
The apostrophe will not be entered in the cell and the number will be formatted as text.  
Because it is in text format, however, you won't be able to calculate with this number.  
Format a cell with a number format such as \0000.  
This format can be assigned in the Format code box under Format - Cells... - Numbers tab and defines the cell display as "always put a zero first and then the integer, having at least three places, and filled with zeros at the left if less than three digits".  
If, however, you have imported an entire column with numbers in "text format", i.e. in the form of "000123", which you now want to turn into "real" numbers again without zeros in front of them, i.e. in the form of "123", proceed as follows:  
Select the column in which the digits are found in "text format".  
Set the cell format in that column as "Number".  
Call up Edit - Find & Replace  
In the Search for box, enter ^[0-9]  
In the Replace with box enter: &  
Put a check in front of Regular expressions  
Put a check in front of Current selection only  
Click Replace All  
Freezing Rows or Columns as Headers  
If, for example, you want to freeze rows 1 and 2 as the header, so that during scrolling these two rows are always visible, then proceed as follows:  
Put the cursor in cell A3.  
Start the Window - Freeze command.  
If you want to deactivate the freeze, restart the command.  
The freezing takes place in the top left corner of the current cell.  
If the area defined is to be scrollable, apply the Window - Split command.  
If you want to print a certain row on all pages of a document, choose Format - Print ranges - Edit.

Profit  
= B4*(B1 - B2) - B3  
2000  
6000  
Calculating With One Formula and One Variable  
To calculate the profit, first enter any number as the quantity (items sold) - in this example 2000.  
The profit is found from the formula Profit=Quantity * (Selling price - Direct costs) - Fixed costs.  
Enter this formula in B5.  
In column D enter certain annual sales one under the other, e.g. in steps of 500 from 500 to 5000.  
Mark the range D2:E11, and thus the values in column D and the empty cells alongside in column E.  
Choose Data - Multiple operations.  
With the cursor in the Formulas field, click cell B5.  
Set the cursor in the Column field and click cell B4.  
This means that:  
B4, the quantity, is the variable in the formula which is replaced by the marked column values.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
You will see the profit in column E.  
Calculating with Several Formulas Simultaneously  
Delete column E.  
Enter the following formula in C5: = B5 / B4.  
You are now calculating the annual profit per item sold.  
Select the range D2;F11, thus three columns.  
Choose Data - Multiple Operations.  
With the cursor in the Formulas field, mark cells B5 thru C5.  
Set the cursor in the Columns field and click cell B4.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
You will now see the profits in column E and the annual profit per item in column F.  
Multiple Operations Across Rows and Columns  
%PRODUCTNAME allows you to carry out joint multiple operations for columns and rows in so-called cross-tables.  
The formula cell has to refer to both the data range arranged in rows and the one arranged in columns.  
Select the range defined by both data ranges and call the multiple operation dialog.  
The Row field is used to enter the reference to the first cell of the range arranged in rows and the Column field the first cell of the range arranged in columns.  
Calculating with Two Variables  
Consider columns A and B of the sample table above.  
You now want to vary not just the quantity produced annually, but also the selling price, and you are interested in the profit in each case.  
Expand the table shown above.  
D2 thru D11 contain the numbers 500, 1000 and so on, up to 5000.  
In E1 through H1 enter the numbers 8, 10, 15 and 20.

Select the range D1:H11.  
Choose Data - Multiple Operations.  
With the cursor in the Formulas field, click cell B5.  
Set the cursor in the Rows field and click cell B1.  
This means that B1, the selling price, is the horizontally entered variable (with the values 8, 10, 15 and 20).  
Set the cursor in the Column field and click in A1.  
This means that B4, the quantity, is the vertically entered variable.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
You will see the profits in the range E2:H11.  
In some cases you must first press (F9) to update the table.  
Multiple operations  
Showing Multiple Sheets  
Using the navigation buttons connect up the display of the sheet tabs for all sheets.  
Click the button on the far right of this group and the display of the sheet tabs will be moved so that you can see the name of the last sheet.  
To display the sheet itself click on the name.  
If at the lower window border there is insufficient space to display the sheet tabs, you can increase it.  
In doing so you will be sharing the available space between the sheet tabs and horizontal scroll bar.  
Point to the separator between the scroll bar and the sheet tabs, press the mouse button and, keeping the mouse button pressed, drag to the right.  
Applying Multiple Sheets  
In the default %PRODUCTNAME displays three sheets "Sheet1" to "Sheet 3" in each new spreadsheet.  
Insert sheet  
In the context menu, use the Insert Sheet command to insert either a new sheet or an existing sheet from another file in front of the active sheet.  
Select multiple sheets  
The sheet tab of the current sheet is always visible in white in front of the other sheet tabs.  
The other sheet tabs are gray when they are not selected.  
By clicking other sheet tabs while pressing Command Ctrl you can select more sheets.  
Undo selection  
In order to undo the selection of a sheet, click its sheet tab again whilst pressing the (Command) (Ctrl) -key.  
The current sheet that is visible cannot be removed from the selection.  
Write values simultaneously to multiple sheets  
If multiple sheets are selected, all values entered into the active sheet will automatically be inserted in the other selected sheets (i.e., data entered in Sheet 1, cell A1 also appears in the same cell of Sheet 2).  
Calculate function across multiple sheets (e.g. the mean of cell A1 across all sheets)  
Enter the formula as follows: =MEAN(Sheet1.A1:Sheet50.A1).  
In the formula cell the mean is now shown across all the A1 cells of your 50 sheets.  
Inserting and Editing Notes  
You can assign a note to each cell by choosing Insert - Note.  
The note is indicated by a small red square, the note indicator, in the cell.  
The note is visible whenever the mouse pointer is over the cell, provided you have activated Help - Tips or Extended Tips.  
When you select the cell, you can choose Show Note from the context menu of the cell.  
Doing so keeps the note visible until you deactivate the Show Note command from the same context menu.  
To edit a permanently visible note, just click in it.  
If you delete the entire text of the note, then the note itself is deleted.  
Another way to delete a note is by choosing Edit - Delete Contents, or calling the same dialog with the Delete key.  
To show or hide the note indicator, choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - View and mark or unmark the Note indicator check box.

Defining Number of Pages for Printing  
If a sheet is too large for a single printed page, %PRODUCTNAME Calc will print the current sheet evenly divided over several pages.  
Since the automatic page break does not always take place in the optimal position, you can define the page distribution yourself.  
Go to the sheet to be printed.  
Choose View - Page Break Preview.  
You will see the automatic distribution of the sheet across the print pages.  
The automatically created print ranges are indicated by dark blue lines, and the user-defined ones by light blue lines.  
The page breaks (line breaks and column breaks) are marked as black lines.  
You can move the blue lines with the mouse.  
You will find further options in the Context menu, including adding an additional print range, removing the scaling and inserting additional manual line and column brakes.

You have a sheet that is so large that it will be printed on four pages.  
The pages will be arranged as follows:  
Page 1  
Page 3  
Page 2  
Page 4  
The top two rows of the sheet should not only be printed on pages 1 and 3, but also as the top rows on the printed pages 2 and 4.  
The first column A should not only be printed on pages 1 and 2, but also on pages 3 and 4.

Addresses and References, Absolute and Relative  
Relative Addressing  
The cell in column A, row 1 is addressed as A1.  
You can address a range of adjacent cells by first entering the coordinates of the upper left cell of the area, then a colon followed by the coordinates of the lower right cell.  
For example, the square formed by the first four cells in the upper left corner is addressed as A1:B2.  
By addressing an area in this way, you are making a relative reference to A1:B2.  
Relative here means that the reference to this area will be adjusted automatically when you copy the formulas.  
Absolute Addressing  
Absolute references are the opposite of relative addressing.  
A dollar sign is placed before each letter and number in an absolute reference, e.g., $A$1:$B$2.  
%PRODUCTNAME can convert the current reference, in which the cursor is positioned in the input line, from relative to absolute and vice versa by pressing Shift +F4.  
If you start with a relative address such as A1, the first time you press this key combination, both row and column are set to absolute references ($A$1).  
If you press the key combination once more, both column and row references are switched back to relative (A1)  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc shows the references to a formula.  
If, for example you click the formula =SUM(A1:C5;D15:D24) in a cell, the two referenced areas in the sheet will be highlighted in color.  
For example, the formula component "A1:C5" may be in blue and the cell range in question bordered in the same shade of blue.  
The next formula component "D15:D24" can be marked in red in the same way.  
When to Use Relative and Absolute References  
What distinguishes a relative reference?  
Assume you want to calculate in cell E1 the sum of the cells in range A1:B2.  
The formula to enter into E1 would be: =SUM(A1:B2).  
If you later decide to insert a new column in front of column A, the elements you want to add would then be in B1:C2 and the formula would be in F1, not in E1.  
After inserting the new column, you would therefore have to check and correct all formulas in the sheet, and possibly in other sheets.  
Fortunately, %PRODUCTNAME does this work for you.  
After having inserted a new column A, the formula =SUM(A1:B2) will be automatically updated to =SUM(B1:C2).  
Absolute and relative references are always adjusted in %PRODUCTNAME Calc whenever the referenced area is moved.  
But be careful if you are copying a formula since in that case only the relative references will be adjusted not the absolute references.  
Absolute references are used when a calculation refers to one specific cell in your sheet which contains a percent value, for example.  
If a formula that refers to exactly this cell is copied relatively to a cell below the original cell, the reference will also be moved down if you didn't define the cell coordinates as absolute.  
Aside from when new rows and columns are inserted, references can also change when an existing formula referring to particular cells is copied to another area of the sheet.  
Assume, for example, you entered the formula =SUM(A1:A9) in row 10.  
If you want to calculate the sum for the adjacent column to the right, simply copy this formula to the cell to the right.  
The copy of the formula in column B will be automatically adjusted to =SUM(B1:B9).  
Renaming Sheets  
Click the name of the sheet that you want to change, e.g. "Sheet1".  
Open the context menu and choose the Rename command.  
A dialog box appears where you can enter a new name.  
Enter a new name for the sheet and click OK.  
Alternatively hold down the Option key (Alt)-key and click on any sheet name and enter the new name directly.  
Spaces are also permitted.  
The name of a sheet is independent of the name of the spreadsheet.  
The document can contain up to 256 individual sheets which can have different names.  
Using Rounded Off Numbers  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc, all decimal numbers are displayed rounded off to two decimal places.  
To change this for selected cells  
Mark all the cells you want to modify.  
Choose Format - Cell and go to the Numbers tab page.  
In the Category field, select Number.  
Under Options, change the number of Decimal places and exit the dialog with OK.  
To permanently change this everywhere  
Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet.  
Go to the Calculate page.  
Modify the number of Decimal places and exit the dialog with OK.  
To calculate with the rounded off numbers instead of the internal exact values  
Choose Tools - Options - Spreadsheet.  
Go to the Calculate page.  
Mark the Accuracy as shown field and exit the dialog with OK.

Using Scenarios  
Scenarios are important aids for making numbers that are dependent on each other and their resulting calculations visible.  
Modify specific basic requirements in the table and you will see the new result.  
You can give a name to the scenario created in this manner and compare it with other scenarios.  
Using Ready-Made Scenarios  
We have provided a ready-made example of scenarios for you to work with.  
Choose File - New - Templates and Documents and from the dialog open the Samples.  
Open the spreadsheet examples.  
Now you see the spreadsheet documents that come with the program.  
Double-click the document with Recar in the name.  
What you see is a sample spreadsheet in which several scenarios have been created.  
Areas in which the scenarios that differ by initial values are located are surrounded by frames.  
Select the appropriate scenario in the list box appearing at the top of every frame.  
Scenarios can also be selected in the Navigator:  
Open the Navigator with the F5 key or the Navigator icon on the function bar.  
Click the Scenarios icon in the Navigator (the icon with the question and exclamation marks).  
In the Navigator you see the defined scenarios with the comments that were entered when the scenarios were created.  
Creating Your Own Scenarios  
To create a scenario, select all the cells that provide the data for the scenario.  
In our example you can create an additional scenario called "High Dollar Rate" for example.  
Do the following:  
Select the cells that are already highlighted by the frame of the existing scenario.  
You can also multiple-select cells that are not contiguous, i.e. that are distributed across the table.  
To select multiple cells, hold down the Command Ctrl key as you click each cell.  
In our example, however, select the range F18:F23.  
The Create Scenario dialog appears.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
Your new scenario is automatically activated.  
Change the values in the frames to the values you want to apply to your new scenario.  
In this case, modify the dollar rate and all other values that you believe could be affected by it, i.e. economic growth and sales prices.  
In just a moment you see the effects of your operating figures.  
If you want to know which values in the scenario affect other values, choose Tools - Detective - Track to Dependents.  
You will see arrows to the cells that are directly dependent on the current cell.  
Creating Scenarios  
Applying Sort Lists  
Enter the text "Jan" or "January" in an empty cell.  
Drag over several cells to the right or downwards.  
When you release the mouse button, the highlighted cells will be filled with the names of the months.  
You can also create your own lists tailored to your needs, such as a list of your company's branch offices.  
When you later want to use the information in these lists (for example, as headings), just enter the first name in the list and expand the entry by dragging it with your mouse.  
Sort lists  
Applying Advanced Filters  
Copy the column headers of the sheet areas to be filtered into an empty area of the sheet, and then enter the criteria for the filter in a row beneath the headers.  
As a result, horizontally arranged data in a row will always be logically connected with AND and vertically arranged data in a column will always be logically connected with OR.  
Once you have created a filter matrix, select the sheet areas to be filtered, open the Advanced Filter dialog, and define the filter conditions.  
Then click OK and you will see that only the rows from the original sheet whose contents have met the search criteria are still visible.  
All other rows are temporarily hidden and can be made to reappear with the Format - Rows - Show command.  
Example  
Load a spreadsheet with the highest possible number of records.  
We are assuming here a fictitious Turnover document, but you can just as easily use any other document.  
The document has the following appearance:  
A  
B  
C  
D  
E  
1  
Month  
Standard  
Business  
Luxury  
Suite  
2  
January  
12560  
200500  
24000  
17000  
3  
February  
16000  
180300  
36200  
22000  
4  
March  
17000  
and so on...  
Copy row 1 with the row headers (field names), to row 20, for example.  
Enter the filter conditions linked with OR in rows 21, 22, etc.  
A  
B  
C  
D  
E  
20  
Month  
Standard  
Business  
Luxury  
Suite  
21  
="January "  
22  
<160000  
Here you specify that only rows which either have the value "January" in the Month field OR a value of under 160000 in the Default field will be displayed.  
Select the command Data - Filter - Advanced Filter..., and then select the area A20:E22.  
After you click OK, only the filtered rows will be displayed in the sheet area.  
The other rows will be hidden from view.  
Applying Default Filters  
Activate the Standard Filter dialog with the entry - Standard - in the AutoFilter or via the command Data - Filter - Standard Filter....  
You can specify up to three filter conditions.  
The Standard Filter dialog is described in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
In the illustration, the conditions have been defined so that only the rows which contain "January" in the Month field, and a value greater than or equal to 160,000 in the Standard field are displayed.  
Data - Filter - Default filter  
Text Superscript / Subscript  
In the cell select the character that you want to put in superscript or subscript.  
If, for example, you want to write H20, select the 2 in the cell (not in the input line).  
Open the context menu for the selected character and select the Character command.  
You will see the Character dialog.  
Select the Font position tab.  
Select the Subscript option and click OK.  
Context menu - Character - Font position  
Rotating Tables (Transposing)  
In %PRODUCTNAME Calc, is there a way to "rotate" a spreadsheet so that rows become columns and vice versa?  
First mark the area of the table that you want to transpose.  
Choose the Edit - Cut menu item  
Undo the selection.  
Set the cursor in the cell that is to be the top left cell in the result.  
Choose the Edit - Content menu item  
In the dialog, in the Select area mark Add all and in the Options area the Transpose check box.  
If you now click on the OK button the columns and lines are swapped.  
Paste special  
Changing Table Views  
To permanently hide column and line headers in a table  
Under the menu item Tools - Options - Spreadsheet, go to the View register.  
Confirm deactivation with OK.  
To hide grid lines  
Under the menu item Tools - Options - Spreadsheet, go to the View register.  
Unmark Grid lines.  
Confirm deactivation with OK.  
Formating Numbers as Text  
You can also enter numbers in the "Text" format.  
These will be interpreted as text.  
The display of these "numbers" is left-justified just like normal text.  
You cannot calculate with numbers in text format!  
They will not be converted.  
Only numbers entered thereafter or numbers which are then edited will become "text" numbers.  
If you decide to enter a number directly as text, enter an apostrophe (') first, for example for years in column headings' 1999, '2000 and' 2001.  
The apostrophe is not visible in the cell, it only signalizes that the entry is to be recognized as a text.  
This is useful, for example, if you enter a telephone number or ZIP code that begins with a zero (0), because a zero (0) at the start of a sequence of digits is removed in normal number formats.  
Format - Cell - Numbers  
Rotating Text  
Select the cells whose text you want to rotate.  
Start the Format - Cells command.  
You will see the Cell attributes dialog.  
Select the Alignment tab.  
In the Text direction area use the mouse to select in the preview wheel the direction in which the text is to be rotated.  
Click OK.  
In the Text direction area if you press the ABCD button, the text is written vertically in the direction of the characters.  
Format - Cells  
Format - Cells - Alignment  
Writing Multiline Text  
Pressing the Command Ctrl +Enter keys inserts a manual line break.  
This shortcut only works directly in the cell, not in the input line.  
If the text should automatically break at the right border of the cell, proceed as follows:  
Select all cells in which the text should break at the right border:  
In Format - Cell - Alignment mark the Line break field and then click OK.  
Format - Cell  
Defining Functions Yourself  
You can apply user-defined functions in %PRODUCTNAME Calc in the following ways:  
In the %PRODUCTNAME Help you will find information for when you want to program the functions as add-ins.  
This method requires advanced knowledge of programming.  
Using the Basic-IDE, even without any knowledge of programming, you can define your own functions.  
You will find the instructions in the following lines:  
In this example we define a VOL(a; b; c) function which calculates the volume of a rectangular parallelepiped with side lengths a, b and c.  
Defining Your Own Functions in Basic IDE  
Choose Tools - Macro.  
The Macro dialog appears.  
Click the Edit button.  
You will now see the Basic IDE.  
Enter the function, as displayed in the illustration.  
Close the Basic-IDE window with the close area on the title bar.  
Your function is automatically saved in the default module and is from now on always available in your %PRODUCTNAME.  
If you apply the function in a Calc document, which is to be used on another computer, you can copy the function to the Calc document.  
You will find the instructions below under the heading "Copying user-defined functions to a document".  
Applying a user-defined function in %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Once you have defined the function VOL(a; b; c) in the Basic-IDE, you can apply it in exactly the same way as the built-in functions of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Open a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document and enter a few numbers, for example, in columns A, B and C.  
Set the cursor in cell D1 and enter the following:  
=VOL(A1;B1;C1)  
The function is evaluated and you will see the result in cell D1.  
Copying user-defined functions to a document  
In stage 2 of "Defining a user-defined function in Basic-IDE" in the Macro dialog you clicked on Edit.  
As the default, in the Macro from field the soffice - Default - Module1 module is selected.  
The default module resides locally in your user directory.  
If you want to copy the user-defined function to a Calc document, proceed as follows:  
Choose Tools - Macro.  
In the Macro from field select soffice - Default - Module1.  
Click Edit.  
In the Basic-IDE select the source of your user-defined function and copy it to the clipboard.  
Close the Basic-IDE.  
Choose Tools - Macro.  
In the Macro from field select (Name of the Calc document)- Default - Module1.  
Click Edit.  
Paste the clipboard contents in the Basic-IDE of the document.  
Switch to "%PRODUCTNAME Basic Help", then search for "Integrated Development Environment (IDE)".  
Validity of Cell Contents  
For each cell you can define in advance what type of contents will be valid for this cell.  
This will make it easier for users of your sheets to employ them correctly.  
The validity rule is activated when a new value is entered.  
If an invalid value has already been inserted into the cell, or if you insert a value in the cell either with drag and drop or by copying and pasting, the validity rule will not take effect.  
You can choose Tools - Detective at any time and choose the command Mark Invalid Data to display which cells contain invalid values.  
Additional details about Data Validity can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Using Cell Contents Validity  
1.  
Select the cells for which you want to define a new validity rule.  
You can select multiple cells by clicking on all respective cells while holding down the Command Ctrl key.  
The validity rule is a component of the cell format.  
To copy the validity rule to other cells, choose Edit - Copy and Edit - Paste Special, and select "Format."  
2.  
Choose Data - Validation....  
The Data Validation dialog appears.  
3.  
On the Values tab page, enter the conditions for new values entered into cells.  
Values you have already entered will not be affected.  
4.  
In the field Allow, "All Values" is selected by default.  
This means that there are no restrictions.  
You can choose one of the other options:  
Whole Number, Decimal, Date, Time, and Text Length.  
5.  
This choice already sets the first condition.  
If you choose "Whole Numbers", values such as "12.5" are not allowed, even if they satisfy the other conditions.  
Choosing "Date" allows date information both in the form "1/1/97" as well as in the form of a serial date.  
Similarly, the "Time" condition permits time values as "12:00" or serial time numbers. "Text Length" stipulates that cells are allowed to contain text only.  
6.  
After you have set the first condition under Allow, select the next condition under Data.  
According to what you choose, additional text fields (Value, Minimum and Maximum) may appear to further specify the condition.  
7.  
A few possible conditions resulting from this register could be as follows: "Integer greater than 1", "Decimal between 10 and 12.5", "Date earlier than or equal to 1/1/2000", "Time not equal to 00:00", "Text with a length of more than 2 characters".  
After you have determined the conditions for cell validity, if any values are subsequently entered which do not meet the conditions, %PRODUCTNAME will display a warning message.  
Fill out the other two tabs in the dialog to specify more detailed messages to aid a user working with your spreadsheet.  
On the Input Help tab page, enter the title and the text of the tip, which will then be displayed if the cell is selected.  
On the Error Alert tab page, select the action to be carried out in the event of an error.  
If you select "Stop" as the action, invalid inputs will not be accepted, and the previous cell contents will be retained.  
Select "Warning" or "Information" to display a dialog in which the entry can either be canceled (the cell value will be retained) or accepted (even if the new value violates the validity rule).  
If you select "Macro", then by using the Browse button you can specify a macro to be carried out in the event of an error.  
After changing the action for a cell on the Error Alert tab page and closing the dialog with OK, you must first select another cell before the change takes effect.  
Data - Validity  
Naming Cells  
If, for example, you have entered a conversion factor of 2.34 in cell X1, you can make the formulas that use this factor easier to read by giving cell X1 a name.  
The formula will then, for example, no longer read = A1 * X1 but = A1 * Conversion factor.  
Select (in this example) cell X1, then start the menu command Insert - Names - Define.  
You will see the Define Names dialog.  
For example, enter the name Conversion factor in the text box.  
Click Add and close the dialog.  
If you now start to enter the name Conversion factor in a formula, after the first few characters entered you will see the entire name as a tip.  
Press the Enter key in order to accept the name from the tip.  
If more than one name starts with the same characters, you can scroll through all the names using the Tab key.  
Insert - Names - Define  
Insert external data in table  
With the help of the Web Page Query %PRODUCTNAME Calc import filter, you can insert tables from HTML documents in a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet.  
You can use the same method to insert areas defined by name from a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet.  
The following insert methods are available:  
Insert by dialog  
Set the cell cursor at the cell from where the new content is to be inserted.  
Choose Insert - External Data.  
This opens the External data dialog.  
In the Combo Box enter the URL of the HTML document or the name of the spreadsheet.  
A dialog may help you with your file selection.  
The selected file is loaded (unseen) in the background.  
Finally, in the large list box of the dialog, you can select the ranges or tables from the file.  
If you want you can specify that the ranges or tables are updated every n seconds.  
Insertion by navigator  
1.  
Open two documents: the %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet in which the external data is to be inserted (target document) and the document from which the external data derives (source document).  
2.  
In the target document open the Navigator.  
3.  
In the lower combo box of the Navigator select the source document.  
The Navigator now shows the range names and database ranges or the tables contained in the source document.  
4.  
In the Navigator select the Insert as link drag mode.  
5.  
Drag the desired external data from the navigator into the target document.  
If you have loaded an HTML document with the Web Page Query filter as the source document, you will find the tables in the Navigator, named continuously from "HTML_table1" onwards, and also two range names that have been created:  
HTML_all - designates the entire document  
HTML_tables - designates all HTML tables in the document  
Editing the external data  
Open Edit - Links.  
Here you can edit the link to the external data.  
External data dialog  
19xx/20xx Years  
The year in the date details is often stated as two digits.  
Internally the year is managed by %PRODUCTNAME as four digits, so that in the calculation of difference from 1/1/99 to 1/1/01 the result will correctly be two years.  
Under Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General you can define up to which year a two-digit year "xx" should be displayed as "20xx".  
This means that if you enter a date of 1/1/30 or higher, it will be treated internally as 1/1/1930 or higher.  
So, for example, 1/1/20 is converted into 1/1/2020.

The functions in %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
This section contains a short overview of some important functions and capabilities of %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Calculating  
It provides you with a spreadsheet containing cells in which you can enter text, digits and formulas and calculate simple and complex results. %PRODUCTNAME Calc has numerous automatic functions to facilitate your work.  
Not only does %PRODUCTNAME Calc provide the basic calculation types but also numerous calculation methods that can be entered interactively with the AutoPilot: Functions  
Additionally, you can enter text and flexibly arrange the cells, so you can comfortably style, fill out, calculate and print your own forms with %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Database Functions  
If your data can be summarized into records, such as addresses, inventory levels, customer orders or similar, then these can also be managed by %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Even if you do not want to calculate anything, you can, for example, quickly sort the database range and search your data for specific characteristics, such as maximum or minimum values.  
In addition, a sheet in %PRODUCTNAME Calc can serve as a data source for creating form letters with %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
Arranging Data  
You can organize data in easy-to-read lists.  
With just a few mouse-clicks, you can reorganize the view to show or hide certain data ranges, format ranges according to special conditions, or calculate subtotals and totals.  
Examining and Extrapolating Data  
The data in your %PRODUCTNAME Calc tables can be examined in detail in many different ways. %PRODUCTNAME Calc is useful for creating term papers because it supports many statistical functions such as regression analyses.  
And for daily calculations at work, the integrated financial functions are helpful, because they can be used to print detailed tables of current credits and loans and other data.  
What-If Calculations  
An interesting feature is immediately viewing results of changes made to one factor of calculations composed of several factors.  
For instance, see how changing the period in a loan calculation affects the interest rates or repayment amounts.  
Furthermore, you can manage larger tables by using different predefined scenarios.  
Dynamic Charts  
%PRODUCTNAME Calc lets you display spreadsheet data in a clear way by selecting the data to be displayed and clicking the Insert Chart icon.  
Drag open a frame at the required position, define specific chart settings in the dialog that appears.  
The chart is inserted at the selected position and, if the source data is modified, will be dynamically updated.  
Importing and Exporting Data  
You can import data from other spreadsheets programs, edit them in %PRODUCTNAME Calc and, if you want, output them in different export formats.  
Referencing Data in Networks and Internet  
Instead of having a fixed value or formula that refers to other cells in the sheet, each %PRODUCTNAME Calc cell can also contain a reference to contents in other documents.  
The documents referred to do not have to exist on your local computer, they can also be stored in a network or anywhere in the Internet.

Scaling  
This is where you can control the scaling of the Y axis.  
The X axis can also be scaled here for X-Y charts.  
The Y axis is automatically scaled by %PRODUCTNAME so that all values are optimally displayed.  
To achieve specific results, you can manually change the axis scaling.  
For example, you are not showing all the complete columns in a column chart but only the top area by shifting the zero line upwards.  
The height difference between the columns has a much more notable effect here than if all the columns were visible in the chart.  
Scale axes  
You can enter values for subdividing axes in this area.  
You can automatically set the five properties Minimum, Maximum, Major interval, Minor interval and Axis at.  
Minimum  
Enter a minimum value for the beginning of the Y axis.  
Maximum  
Enter a maximum value for the end of the Y axis.  
Major Interval  
Enter the interval for the main division of the axes.  
The main intervall cannot be larger than the value area.  
Minor Interval  
Enter the interval for the subdivision of the axes.  
Axis at:  
Specify in which position to display the values along the y axis.  
This allows you to move the axis also to -10 and to extend the bars artificially.  
Automatic  
You must first deselect the Automatic option in order to modify the values.  
If you are working with "fixed" values, you should probably disable this feature, since it does not allow automatic (dynamic) scaling.  
Logarithmic scale  
Check here if you want the y axis to be subdivided logarithmically.  
Use this feature if you are working with values that differ sharply from each other.  
You can use logarithmic scaling to make the grid lines of the axis equidistant but have values that may increase or decrease.  
Axis marks  
Specify in this area if the marks are to be on the inner or outer side of the axis.  
It is possible to combine both: you will see then a mark on both sides.  
inner  
Defines the marks to be put on the inner side of the axis  
outer  
Defines the marks to be put on the outer side of the axis.  
Tick marks  
This area is used to define the marking dashes between the axis marks.  
This will result in a marking line running from the outside to the inside.  
inner  
Check here if you want to put the tick marks on the inner side of the axis.  
outer  
Check here if you want to put the tick marks on the outer side of the axis.

Chart type  
A selection of chart types is displayed in this area.  
The selection contains the most conventional types, including XY charts and net charts.  
The active chart is marked by a highlighted frame and its name is displayed in the lower part of this area.  
Lines, areas, columns, bars, pies, XY charts, net and stock charts are the different types of available 2D charts.  
The gray background has a better optical display in the net, XY and lines chart types.  
You can, however, change this default.  
In pie charts, you have the possibility to drag each piece and place it outside the main chart, but the radius of the chart will change and the chart will be placed inside a defined frame.  
You can also select the whole chart and modify its size.  
For stock charts, the rises and drops of stock prices, sales volumes and the total number of shares are selected using icons.  
By default, the size of the icons does not exceed that of the line width.  
This makes the points semi-transparent.  
Only the closing stock price is visibly marked by a small dash.  
All points are not visible until you integrate other graphics.  
In 3D charts you can choose from lines, areas, bars, columns, and pies.  
Click the corresponding illustration to select the chart type.  
At the same time, the corresponding variations appear in the Variants area.  
If you modify the scale axes of line charts, two dimensional charts and XY charts, you can get an incomplete display if the icons are located outside the grids.  
Also, statistic lines will be only displayed if their center is located within the rectangle area.  
Variants  
The variants of the chart type selected are displayed here.  
The chart type variants displayed here depend on the selected dimension and chart type.  
Lines and columns.  
If, on the other hand you selected a 3D Bars chart type, some of the available variants will be Tubes, Horizontal pyramids, Horizontal cones, etc.  
The variant you choose is applied to the whole chart.  
Both the names of the chart types and their variants are displayed if you have enabled the Note command in the Help menu and then move the mouse pointer over the icons.  
Even if Note is not turned on, at least the name of the selected type or the selected variants will be displayed in the given area.  
Data points order  
In Line charts and XY charts you can select one of the spline possibilities.  
You'll see this combo box with the B Splines.  
Define the order of the B Spline curve here.  
A line results by 1, a parabola with 2, generally in n a parabola of the n order.

Overview of %PRODUCTNAME Chart  
This section contains a short overview of the extensive chart functionality in %PRODUCTNAME.  
You can select a range of data in a spreadsheet or table and then directly insert a chart based on that data.  
The selected data will be applied to the chart and maintain a "live" connection, i.e. if the source data is altered, the chart will automatically be modified.  
Various Chart Types  
Choose between the normal two dimensional charts, e.g. bar charts, line charts, stock charts and 3D charts.  
Changing from one chart type to another is easily done.  
If you are using line charts, then a lot of statistical values calculated by %PRODUCTNAME can also be displayed.  
There are four variants available if you are using stock charts.  
It is, for example, possible to combine turnover and typical stock data.  
In %PRODUCTNAME, you can display any number of rows of data as a stock chart.  
In many of the chart types you can add guides to axes as well as the actual markings for better scaling possibilities.  
Universal Formatting  
The individual elements of the charts can be formatted by using their context menus or the normal menus and the toolbars.  
Among others, you can format the labels, scaling, backgrounds and other elements to correspond to your wishes for the chart.

If you have selected two or more objects together, they will be aligned to each other.  
A special type of alignment is the Distribution of objects.  
If you select at least three objects at once, you can use the Distribution command.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Impress, this command is found on the context menu, whereas in %PRODUCTNAME Draw it is found on the Modify menu.  
The selected objects are distributed so that their borders or midpoints are the same distance apart.  
The two objects that are the horizontally or vertically farthest apart from each other are fixed points, i.e. immovable.  
The other objects between the outermost objects can be moved using this function.  
Remember that everywhere in %PRODUCTNAME a multi-level undo function is available.  
Activate this function by clicking the Undo icon on the function bar or by pressing Command Ctrl +Z.  
Each time you use this command, it reverses a previous action.  
Defining Your Own Colors  
You can define any number of colors, assign them names and save in color palette files.  
In a drawing document, choose Format - Area... to open the Area dialog.  
In the dialog, click the Colors tab.  
Here you will find everything you need to modify the color of a selected object.  
You can also define and organize new colors.  
If you want to apply a color which is not yet in the color palette, you first have to define a new color and assign a name to it.  
They will be saved automatically, and are irreversible.  
This will not present problems if you only want to add one new color to the palette, but it can create difficulties if you change the standard colors.  
To define a new color, the best thing to do is choose a color from the color palette which resembles the new color.  
It will be displayed in the upper of the two preview boxes.  
Select the color model in the list box according to how you want to define the new colors.  
The list box recognizes the two settings RGB and CMYK.  
The color models RGB and CMYK are just two of the models most used to define colors.  
It describes very well the corresponding colors if the colors are combined on the computer monitor form the three basic colors.  
It is the color model that best describes the subtractive color creation in print colors.  
Select the color model that corresponds to the desired output medium (monitor or a printer).  
If you are exposing image files, it is best to ask the photo-exposure service in which color model and format the image is expected.  
Define the colors by modifying the values in the spin boxes.  
Enter values directly, or click the buttons to change the existing values.  
The result is shown immediately in the lower preview box.  
This opens the Color dialog.  
Select the color and click OK.  
Once you have chosen a new color, you must specify whether it should replace the original color or be defined independently.  
Click Modify, if you want to replace the color displayed in the upper preview box.  
We suggest, however, that you only replace custom-defined colors.  
To set the new user-defined color, assign a name to the color in the Name field, and click Add and OK.  
Your new color will immediately be added to the palette of existing colors.  
However, the modifications in the color palette will remain in effect.  
You can find further instructions in the %PRODUCTNAME Help on saving and loading the color palette and other palette files.  
Color bar  
Combining Objects and Constructing Shapes  
In %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress you can combine graphic objects in different ways.  
Several single objects can be brought together to create new objects by using Boolean set operators on the original geometry.  
Combining Objects  
Select several objects.  
Choose Combine from the context menu.  
In contrast to groups, which consist of single objects, a combination fuses the component objects into one single new geometric object with its own new properties.  
The combination may be undone again later, but the individual objects get lost.  
You recognize the property that stands out the most in a combination when the individual objects overlap.  
In this case, the style quantity overall is punched out as "holes" where a number of objects overlaps.  
This is a Boolean exclusive-OR (XOR) operation.  
In the illustration, you can see several objects at the left before being combined, and at the right after being combined.  
The combination is given the attributes of the object farthest to the back (i.e. undermost object).  
Constructing Shapes  
The commands Shapes - Merge, Subtract and Intersect also form a new geometric object out of the original objects.  
The new object comes into being due to the use of logical amount operators on the source geometries.  
Select several objects.  
Choose Shapes from the context menu.  
In the submenu, choose Merge, Subtract or Intersect.  
In the followintg illustrations you see the original shapes on the left and the result on the right.  
Shapes - Merge  
The selected polygons are merged so that they make one object, the surface of which is the sum of all the parts (Boolean OR).  
Shapes - Subtract  
All other polygons selected are subtracted from the undermost polygon.  
This entails the other polygons first being merged and then subtracted from the polygon positioned under/behind all the others.  
Holes will be taken into account.  
Logically this operation corresponds to the following formula:  
A - (B1 _BAR_..... _BAR_ Bn)  
Shapes - Intersect  
The selected polygons are joined into one single polygon that corresponds to the intersection area (Boolean AND).  
Only the area where all polygons overlap remains.  
You can also choose Shapes - Subtract and Shapes - Intersect to cut parts out of a bitmap, for example.  
The illustration shows examples.  
Cross-Fading Between Two Objects  
The cross-fading function is only available for drawings in %PRODUCTNAME Draw and not in %PRODUCTNAME Impress documents.  
To insert into a presentation an object that was created by cross-fading two objects, copy it from the drawing into the presentation document by way of the clipboard.  
In the process of cross-fading a transition between two objects is calculated and the increments will be positioned on the page.  
In the increments, the form, orientation, and color of the objects, as well as other attributes, are adjusted uniformly.  
For example, in an empty drawing document, draw an object at the bottom left and another one at the upper right (use two different colors).  
Select both objects.  
A dialog appears where you can define further settings.  
Click OK.  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw calculates the increments and displays the results.  
This new object is a group which consists of the specified number of individual objects.  
You can enter the group (press F3) to edit the individual objects.  
The Modify menu in %PRODUCTNAME Draw contains all the necessary commands for working with groups and these functions can be also found in %PRODUCTNAME Impress under the Format - Group menu command or in the context menu.  
Further information can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Editing - Cross-fading  
Drawing Sectors and Segments  
The Ellipse floating toolbar contains several icons for drawing sectors and segments.  
Sectors look like "perfectly cut pieces of pie".  
Segments look like halves of a pie.  
Drawing sectors of an ellipse or circle requires multiple steps, though the process functions intuitively:  
1.  
Open the Ellipse floating toolbar and click on the Circle Pie icon.  
The pointer changes to a cross-hair symbol accompanied by a small sector symbol.  
2.  
Use the mouse to drag open the shape of a circle.  
The outline of a circle follows the movement of the mouse.  
Your first click defines the first corner of the delimiting rectangle which surrounds the circle.  
The delimiting rectangle will later be obvious via the eight handles seen when you select the circle.  
To draw the circle such that the first click defines the center, press the Option Alt key while dragging the mouse.  
3.  
Release the mouse button when the circle has reached the desired size.  
Now you'll notice that a radius which follows the movement of the mouse is drawn in the circle.  
4.  
Position the radius at the point where you want to place one boundary of the sector and click once.  
5.  
Now when you move the mouse, you'll see that the first radius is set and a second radius follows the movement of the mouse.  
As soon as you click again, the circle pie is complete.  
Drawing ellipse pies is done in a similar fashion.  
The dimensions of the delimiting rectangle, formed when you first drew the shape, determines the dimensions of the ellipse.  
When drawing a segment, proceed in exactly the same manner as described above for sectors.  
The only difference is that in the last step no second radius follows the movement of the mouse, but rather a secant (straight line) cuts through the circle.  
With the other icons in the Ellipse floating toolbar, you can draw ellipses and arcs.  
This process also functions as described above although, only the perimeter of the ellipse or the circle is drawn.  
Duplicating Objects  
Duplicating an object allows you to easily make a set number of copies of an object which differ in consistent degrees from one copy to the next in position, orientation, size, and color.  
If you want to draw a stack of coins, for instance, you can use the duplicate function.  
Your basis consists of the bottom coin:  
1.  
Draw an ellipse or circle at the bottom of the slide.  
2.  
Choose the Edit - Duplicate... command to open the Duplicate dialog.  
3.  
Enter the following values:  
4.  
Select 30 as the number of copies.  
If you enter positive values in the field for the x-axis placement, this causes a shift to the right.  
If the stack of coins should increase from the bottom up, enter a negative value in the (vertical) y-direction.  
5.  
If you want the coins to become smaller the higher they get, enter a negative value for the width and height.  
6.  
Finally, define a color scheme from bottom to top.  
Select, for example, a darker yellow for the beginning color (bottom) and a lighter yellow color for the end color (top).  
7.  
Click OK to create the duplicates.  
Edit - Duplicate  
Replacing Colors With the Eyedropper  
You can edit images inserted in a bitmap format (e.g., GIF, JPEG and metafile images (e.g., WMF) in %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress using Eyedropper.  
Open the Eyedropper by choosing Tools - Eyedropper.  
You then see the Eyedropper window.  
The Eyedropper can replace selected colors and, to a point, similar colors, with other colors.  
You can replace up to four colors at one time.  
If you do not like the replacement you can reverse it with one click on Undo on the function bar.  
Use the Eyedropper to match the colors of different bitmaps or to redo a bitmap with the colors of your company logo.  
The Transparency attribute also serves as a color.  
You can replace the transparency in an image with a color, for example, with white.  
This is helpful if, for example, your printer driver is having problems with printing transparent graphics.  
If you want to produce an image on HTML pages to publish in the internet, like the illustration of a product, for example, it usually looks better when you do not see a rectangular picture, but rather only the illustration of the product which is then seen against the uniform background of the web page.  
If there is a white background in the picture behind the product, use the Eyedropper to replace the color white with "Transparent" (i.e. no color) and save and/or export the image in a format that supports the transparency attribute (such as GIF).  
When using this method, be sure that the illustration of the product itself does not contain any white parts, since these would also become transparent just like the background.  
To replace colors with the Eyedropper  
Insert an image in a Bitmap format (e.g., BMP, GIF, JPG, TIG) or in a metafile format (e.g, WMF).  
To do this, choose Insert - Graphics in %PRODUCTNAME Draw and %PRODUCTNAME Impress.  
Open the Eyedropper window by choosing Tools - Eyedropper.  
In the Eyedropper window, click the Eyedropper icon in the upper left-hand corner.  
The mouse pointer will turn into a special pointer with which you then indicate the color to be replaced in the current document.  
The color box next to the eyedropper icon in the Eyedropper window displays the color the mouse pointer is resting on.  
Click the left mouse button when you find the color you want to have replaced.  
This color will automatically be registered in the first of the four rows in the Eyedropper window.  
Now, in the list box to the right in the same row, select the new color which should replace the selected color in the whole bitmap image.  
Now select the eyedropper icon in the upper left-hand corner again and choose a new color.  
Up to four colors can be replaced in one editing step.  
Select the bitmap image or the metafile image you want to change the colors in by clicking it.  
In the Eyedropper window click Replace.  
If too many similar colors were replaced, undo the step through Command Ctrl +Z and decrease the color tolerance in the spin button.  
Then click Replace.  
Eyedropper  
Defining Gradients  
To assign a predefined gradient to an object, proceed as follows:  
Select the object.  
From the context menu or under Format on the menu bar, choose Area....  
Select the Gradient option, then make your selection from the gradient list.  
Defining Your Own Color Gradient  
You can define your own color gradient, save the current color gradient list as a file, or load a different list from another file.  
If you have selected an object and then define a new gradient, the new gradient is immediately assigned to the selected object.  
If you do not want immediate assignment, you must undo the selection before opening the dialog for defining gradients.  
To do this, click with the selection tool on a position where there are no objects.  
1.  
In the Area dialog, click the Gradients tab.  
This is where you can define all of the options for new color gradients.  
2.  
From the list of existing color gradients, click the gradient you want to use as a basis for creating your new color gradient.  
3.  
Click the Add... button.  
In the dialog that appears, you can assign a name for the new gradient.  
For example, enter the name "UFO" and click OK.  
The name appears as a new entry at the end of the list and will already be selected for editing.  
4.  
Click Modify to save the changes in the new gradient.  
The preview shows how the gradient looks.  
5.  
Close the Area dialog with OK.  
You can use the new color gradient immediately.  
Interactively Defining a Color Gradient  
Color gradients can be modified by clicking and dragging them with the mouse.  
In order to be defined interactively, the object must already have a color gradient.  
1.  
Select an object which has a color gradient.  
2.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Draw, open the Effects floating toolbar from the Main toolbar.  
3.  
On the Effects floating toolbar, click the Gradient icon.  
You will now see two objects in color which are linked by a vector.  
Depending on the type of gradient, you can move one or both of the objects with the mouse and thus determine the origin, end and angle of the color gradient.  
When the color bar is displayed, you can move colors by drag and drop to each object to determine the start and end colors.  
In a similar way the transparency of an object can be determined with the Transparency icon.  
Here you can define a grayscale gradient which spans from black (0% transparency, i.e. opaque) to white (100% transparent).  
Inserting Graphics  
Choose Insert - Graphics.  
You will see the Insert Graphics dialog.  
Select the graphics and click Open.  
Mark the Link field if the inserted graphics are to be changed, provided someone has changed the original graphics file.  
Move and scale the graphics as desired.  
Working With a Group of Objects  
Several objects at one time can be selected, grouped, combined, merged, subtracted and intersected.  
Selecting several objects at the same time has a temporary effect - as soon as you click elsewhere on the page or slide, the area will be deselected.  
Grouping and combining are valid until the group or the combination is deselected with the command from the context menu or the Modify menu.  
You can also combine these commands, for example, to group together several groups, add a combination and combine the results as a group or combination.  
Grouping Objects  
You can combine several objects into a group.  
All changes made to a group will have an effect on all objects in the group.  
In particular, groups can be moved, rotated, etc. as a single object.  
For example, if you want to draw a bicycle, you can first construct a wheel, composed of a tire, rim, spokes, and hub, and then you can group these objects together.  
This makes it easy to rotate the wheel, duplicate it, and move the second wheel to the appropriate position.  
Finally, draw the frame and the rest of the bicycle, and form a new group.  
You can edit an object in the group, and exit the group when you are finished.  
Entering Groups  
You enter a group by first selecting (either click it or use the keyboard - see instructions below).  
Then you can decide whether you want to use a context menu command, the F3 key or double-click the group to enter it.  
After entering a group with a double-click, no object in the group is selected).  
Exiting Groups  
To exit a group, you have a choice of using a menu command, the key combination Command Ctrl +F3, or double-clicking outside all of the objects in the group.  
After you exit the group, it is selected, which means that you can quickly enter and exit a group using the keyboard.  
View of Entered Groups  
In order to emphasize the group and the contents thereof, all objects which are not in the entered group (including other groups), will be depicted in the new "Ghost Mode" in faded colors.  
That makes it easy for you to see which objects are available for interaction and which are not, as well as whether you are in a group or not.  
Navigating Between Objects of a Group (or on a Page)  
Using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys you can move forward and backward along the row of objects in a group edited with F3 or on a page.  
If you repress the keys on a final object while going in one direction, the first object selected will appear next.  
Assembling 3D objects  
You can connect two 3D objects to a single object whose contours are the 3D sum of the individual objects.  
With the help of the 3D Objects floating toolbar insert a 3D object in your presentation or drawing, e.g., a dice.  
Insert a second 3D object, for example a sphere that is somewhat larger than the cube.  
Cut the second object (i.e. the sphere) and place it on the clipboard with (Command) (Ctrl) (X).  
To do this, select the cube and press (F3).  
Insert the sphere from the clipboard with (Command) (Ctrl) (V).  
The slide is not a part of the cube's group.  
Exit the group with (Command) (Ctrl) (F3).  
With 3D objects, subtraction and intersection operations are not possible.  
Objects in 3D  
Connecting Lines to Objects  
This is how you create a closed area from several lines in Draw or Impress.  
Using the Connect function, it is possible to link individual lines to produce a solid object.  
The following example shows you how to do this:  
1.  
Draw a triangle, for example, from three individual lines, where the start and end points of the lines are lying closely together in the three corners.  
2.  
Select all three lines together, for example by drawing a rectangle that includes all lines using the select tool (the arrow in the Main Toolbar above).  
3.  
Open the context menu for the selected object and select the Connect command.  
4.  
Open the context menu again and choose Close Object.  
5.  
The object is now closed and can be edited as an area.

Miscellaneous  
Rotating Objects  
When you click the object for the first time, the eight handles with which you can change the size appear.  
You can also drag the whole object to move it to another position on the slide.  
Click the Rotate icon that in %PRODUCTNAME Draw can be found on the main toolbar under Effects and directly on the main toolbar in %PRODUCTNAME Impress.  
If you position the mouse pointer over a handle, the pointer indicates that you can rotate the object by dragging the mouse.  
In the middle of the object, a small circle indicates the pivot point.  
It can be moved to any other position with the mouse.  
Dragging the middle points on the sides slants the object in relation to the opposite edge.  
Click on the object once again to display the eight handles.  
If you double-click within the object, the handles change and the text cursor appears positioned in the middle of the object.  
You can now enter text which is automatically connected to the object.  
Some interference may appear on screen.  
You can then refresh the screen.  
Converting Text Into 3D  
If a text is selected, you can transform the text into a 3D body by choosing Convert - To 3D from the context menu.  
The 3D body will take on the area you created for your text frame.  
You can rotate the 3D text with the Rotate icon in the Effects floating toolbar in the Main toolbar.  
When you click inside the delimiting frame and drag while pressing the mouse button, the object will rotate on all the axes at the same time.  
But when you click one of the eight handles and drag it with a pressed mouse button, the object will rotate on only one axis.  
You can shift the pivot point, which first appears as a small circle in the middle.  
When you then rotate the object, it will rotate around the new pivot point.  
Open the 3D Effects window by clicking the 3D Controller icon.  
You can apply another illumination to the 3D object, for example.  
The 3D Effects window is described in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Entering Text  
If you want to enter a text in your drawing, you can decide if you want the text to have a "normal" format as in a text document or if the text should be handled as a graphic object that you can rotate, expand, minimize, etc.  
You can also have a "normal" text appear in the form of a legend (in a frame with an arrow).  
Open the Text floating toolbar from the main toolbar.  
(If you have activated the Asian language support under Tools - Options -Language Settings - Languages, you will see additional icons for entering vertical text.)  
Normal Text  
1.  
You can enter "normal" text by clicking the Text icon.  
2.  
Drag open a delimiting frame in your document which sets the position and maximum width the text area should have.  
If your text is long, you can extend the frame in order to incorporate the whole text.  
However, you will not be able to make the frame smaller than the text itself.  
3.  
Enter the text.  
Select the text by holding down the Shift key while using the arrow keys or use the mouse.  
You can now modify the font and font size as you would in regular text documents.  
When you click the mouse on the document outside the text you leave the Text edit mode.  
If you click the text once again, the text will be selected as an object.  
Now, you can, for example, rotate or shift the entire text.  
When you double-click the text you can edit it again, for example, delete characters or set additional font attributes.  
Fitting Text to Frames  
1.  
With the Fit Text to Frame icon, you can draw a delimiting frame which predetermines the position and size of the text.  
Once having done so, immediately enter your text.  
2.  
Enter your text and afterwards, click in any free area of the document.  
You will notice that the text you entered will be scaled so that it exactly fits into the frame.  
Callouts  
1.  
Using the Callouts icon, drag your mouse from the point which the callout arrow should point to, to the point where the callout text should appear.  
Once you release the mouse button, you can edit the size of the frame of the callout.  
2.  
As soon as you want to enter text into the callout, just double-click the line.  
The callout frame will appear with a wide gray border, indicating that you are now in the text edit mode.  
3.  
Enter the callout text.  
4.  
Change the line properties by clicking on the line, opening your context menu and clicking on the Line command.  
You can select arrowheads for the lines in the Style combo box on the Line tab page.  
Adding Text to Bitmaps  
To apply text to a pixel image in JPEG format, for example, follow these steps:  
1.  
Open a new drawing document.  
2.  
Insert the pixel image by choosing Insert - Graphics.  
3.  
Deselect the image by clicking somewhere else in the document.  
4.  
Open the Text floating toolbar from the Main toolbar and select, for example, the Fit Text to Frame icon.  
5.  
Draw a frame around the pixel image and enter some text inside this frame.  
6.  
You can select this text and assign another color to it.  
The background of the text is automatically transparent.  
7.  
Select the pixel image and the text by, for example, drawing a frame around both.  
On the status bar you will read "2 draw objects selected".  
8.  
Choose File - Export and, in the Export dialog, select the file type "JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group" and enter a name.  
Mark the Selection check box to export only the selected objects.  
9.  
Click Save.  
In another dialog you can now set the options to define the quality of the JPG image.  
Remember that the higher the quality, the larger will the file be.

Functionality in %PRODUCTNAME Draw  
This section contains an overview of some of the %PRODUCTNAME Draw capabilities.  
Creating and Publishing Vector Graphics  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw is an object-oriented vector graphic drawing program.  
The objects can be lines, rectangles, 3D cylinders or other polygons.  
All objects already have set properties, such as size, color of the surfaces, color of contours, linked files, associated actions when clicked and much more.  
All of the properties can be modified at any time.  
Thanks to the vector technology you can rotate objects in any direction and alter their size, without unsightly step effects occurring on the edges.  
Furthermore, as all of the objects can be controlled individually, you can move and overlap them at will.  
Creating 3D Objects  
You are not restricted to two dimensions when using %PRODUCTNAME Draw.  
You can create cubes, spheres, cylinders and other 3D objects, rotate them at will and even illuminate each object by means of various light sources.  
These features together with default or freely defined color gradients, enable you to quickly create eye-catching company and Internet presentations.  
Manage Organization Charts  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw is object-oriented.  
The objects could be rectangles, for example, containing text and linked to each other.  
If you move the rectangles, the connectors will automatically follow.  
This makes drawing and maintaining your company or departmental organizational charts much easier.  
The connectors can also be freely placed at glue points, which makes the creation of technical drawings with explanatory texts easier.  
Draw  
Draw in the usual ways straight lines, free lines, bezier curves and other types of rectangles and geometrical figures.  
The 3D functions can be used to create 3D objects such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, tori and more.  
You can also rotate your own two dimensional contours in the third dimension.

Export  
Use this dialog to export your presentation and drawings or the selected objects in other graphics formats.  
When you choose "Web page" as format, the files are created with the help of AutoPilots.  
You can decide whether to save them in JPEG or GIF format on your local or network data carrier, or on an Internet server (if you have access).  
This dialog is organized similarly to the Save As dialog.  
If you want to export a file in the Export dialog, a filter dialog appears for many formats after clicking the Save button.  
There, you can select your desired export options.  
Which filter dialog appears depends on the format you chose.The following filter dialogs exist:  
HTML Export, JPEG Options, SVM/WMF/PICT/MET Options, BMP Options, GIF Options, EPS Export Options, PNG Options, PBM, PPM, PGM Options.  
For further information on filters see Information on Import and Export Filters.  
Page  
Use this to open the Page Setup dialog in which you define various settings for the paper format, background, etc.  
As soon as you close this dialog with OK you will be asked in a little dialog named Page Setup if the settings made are to apply to all existing and future pages or only to the page currently selected.  
This enables you to assign a different background graphics to each page.  
Confirm the dialog according to your requirements.  
Page  
This is where you format the pages/slides.  
You can define several settings, e.g. the paper format, numbering, and margins.  
The default for new pages/slides is one without margins that fits the screen.  
Paper Format  
This list box contains a selection of the most common paper formats.  
Once you select the format, the settings in the Width and Height spin boxes are automatically changed to the measurements for the format selected.  
When you define your own Width and Height measurements, the format automatically switches to User.  
Format  
In the Format list box, select a predefined paper format, or define the required paper format in the Width and Height list boxes.  
Width  
Enter the width of the paper into this field if you wish to use a width differing from the standard format.  
Height  
Use this field to enter the height of the paper if it is to differ from the standard format.  
Portrait  
Activate this radio button if the document is to be shown or printed in the portrait format.  
Landscape  
Choose this radio button if the document is to be shown or printed in the landscape format.  
paper trays  
If your printer is equipped with multiple paper trays, you can define which paper tray is to be used.  
Selecting the paper tray is necessary if you want to use a different paper format for the second page.  
Margins  
This application is used to define the space between the font and the edge of the page.  
Alterations to the spacing can be made in the corresponding spin box.  
You can also enter different units of measurement that are then automatically converted.  
Left  
Define the size of the space between the data and left edge of the slide in this box.  
Right  
Define the size of the space between the data and right edge of the slide in this box.

Define the size of the space between the data and bottom edge of the slide in this box.  
Format  
Set the type of numbering to be used in this list box.  
Fit object to slide format  
Mark this check box if the arrangement of the drawing objects is to be maintained even if the paper format is changed.  
If this field is checked then all of the objects between the page margins will be redistributed if the page size is altered, so that the page layout is maintained.  
This means that the position, size and font size of the template for presentation objects on the master page will be adjusted to the new layout.  
It is, therefore, possible to show a page layout template on different page formats.

Slide Design  
Drawing View  
The drawing view provides the tools from the toolbar and the menu commands which are available for creating and editing objects.  
Outline View  
This icon activates the Outline view.  
The Outline view enables you to enter topic titles for the single slides of your presentation, to arrange the order of your slides by restructuring the outline and to modify the outline depth.  
For this purpose, the Text Object Bar contains the icons Promote, Demote, Move Up and Move Down.  
On the keyboard, with the cursor at the beginning of a line press the Tab key to make the line one level lower in the hierarchy.  
Press Shift - Tab to make it one level higher.  
If the cursor is not at the beginning of a line, or if you have selected text, pressing the Tab merely inserts a tab stop in the line, without affecting the structure.  
The first outline level contains the individual slides.  
The lower levels correspond to the headings on the slides.

Even when you have several layers, you can still view all drawing elements since the layers are transparent.  
If necessary, you can deny access to a level, make elements on a level invisible, or determine that a level should not be printed.  
To edit the properties of a layer, open the Edit Layer dialog by double-clicking the tab of the layer to be edited.  
If you only want to toggle the visibility of objects on a layer, press Shift and click the tab of that layer.  
The name of the layer is displayed in a distinct manner (e.g., blue or italic) to indicate that the objects there are now invisible.  
If you select an object, a status bar field will indicate the layer where the object is.  
Preview  
Choose this command to view a preview window which shows how the current slide will appear in a presentation.  
When you switch to the master view the preview is automatically shown.  
This allows you to check changes more quickly.  
When you switch to the outline mode you also see the preview window.  
Display Quality  
This menu contains options which determine whether the document is displayed in color.  
The display quality that you set is saved automatically.  
Color  
If you have created backgrounds, fonts or other objects in a presentation or image that are in color and want to view them in color, then choose this option.  
Grayscale  
If you prefer a grayscale display quality, choose this option.  
All colors will be portrayed as shades of gray.  
The gray intensity varies depending on the base color.  
Black and White  
Choose this option for a black and white display, without colors or grayscales.  
This means that a black shadow will turn white with a black outline.

Printable  
Check this box to print the draw elements arranged on the layer.  
Locked  
Select this option to prevent the draw elements on the layer from being edited.  
New Snap Object  
This is where you define a snap point or a vertical/horizontal snap line.  
Snap points or snap lines are used to align drawing objects while drawing.  
However, they are not shown during the presentation or when printing.  
You can also edit, move with numerical precision or delete inserted snap points and lines.  
Snap points and snap lines "magnetically" affect objects that you position near them using the mouse.  
If you move an object or the origin of the rulers close to a snap point or a snap line, the object will be pulled to the snap line or point.  
The same goes for the construction of objects by dragging or clicking with the mouse.  
You determine the snap range under Tools - Options - Drawing - Grid Tools - Options - Presentation - Grid.  
You can also drag snap lines from the rulers onto the page with the mouse and move them around on the page.  
To delete snap lines, you drag them back onto the ruler bar.  
Alternatively, you can open the context menu for a snap line or a snap point where you can edit or delete the snap object as you wish.  
You can change the visibility of all snap lines in the context menu of the slide by using the menu item Visible snap lines.  
In the context menu in the menu item Snap Lines to Front, you select whether the snap lines should be shown in front of or behind the other objects on the slide.  
Position  
In this section, you can position the snap lines or snap points.  
You can always use the mouse to move an inserted snap point or a snap line to another place.  
X axis  
Here, you can determine the position of the horizontal snap line or the X coordinate of the snap point.  
Y axis  
Here, you can determine the position of the vertical snap line or the Y coordinate of the snap point.  
Type  
In this section, the option fields Point, Vertical or Horizontal are shown.  
Point  
Mark this field if you want to insert a snap point.  
The snap point is inserted in the form of a dashed cross.  
Vertical  
Mark this field if you want to insert a vertical snap line.  
Horizontal  
Mark this field if you want to insert a horizontal snap line.  
Edit snap line / point  
The context menu of a snap object contains commands for deleting or moving snap lines and points.  
This dialog is similar to the New Snap Object dialog.  
Delete  
Deletes the current snap point or line.  
The deletion takes place without any security response.  
Spreadsheet  
Inserts an empty spreadsheet at the center of the current slide.  
The functions for editing the spreadsheet are taken from %PRODUCTNAME Calc.  
Double-click inside the spreadsheet later to reedit.  
Click the spreadsheet once to be able to move it or alter its size.  
Insert File  
This is where you open a dialog with which to insert a presentation, HTML or text file into your document.  
You can insert not only files from your local hard drive but also files from the Internet.  
When choosing a file using a URL, you have to enter the complete URL, i.e., including file: / / / or http: / /.  
This dialog corresponds to the Open dialog.  
In the list box File Type, select whether you would like to insert a text, an web page (HTML document) or a presentation document.  
After you have selected a presentation or HTML document, the Insert Slides/Objects dialog appears.  
Here, you can select the slides or objects you would like to insert in a menu tree representation.  
If you selected a text document, the Insert Text dialog appears.  
Select the text file here.  
After confirming your selection in the dialog mentioned, the file or object or the objects are inserted into the current document.  
Insert Slides/Objects  
Inserts an existing %PRODUCTNAME Impress or HTML file into your presentation or draw document.  
A file has been selected using Insert - File and now you can see the dialog.  
If you select nothing, the entire document is inserted.  
Click the plus sign to the left of the file name to select individual pages or objects from %PRODUCTNAME Impress or HTML documents.  
All individual pages are displayed and, for embedded objects, the description.  
Select the pages you want to insert.  
You can use the Shift key and (Command) (Ctrl) to select several pages.  
Once you have selected pages, the following prompt appears in a dialog:  
Do you want to adjust the objects too?  
Click Yes to scale the objects in the pages.  
The %PRODUCTNAME Impress document pages are added as new pages to the current page of the active document.  
Display box  
Select what is to be inserted into the current document in this part of the dialog.  
Link  
Check this box to insert the pages as links, which are automatically updated if changes have been made to the original file.  
If this field has not been checked then a copy of the pages will be inserted.  
Delete unused backgrounds  
When pages are inserted into a presentation or a drawing you can determine if the unused background pages of the inserted file are to be used by the current file or not.  
Check this box and unused background pages will be deleted from the current document.  
Insert text  
This is where you insert a text file (pure ASCII text, RTF or HTML) into a presentation document.  
You can either position a text document freely anywhere on the entire workspace (you can reduce the text after this) or drag open a text frame before pasting; the text is then inserted into the current text frame. (If necessary, it is extended downwards in order to incorporate the whole text.  
You can reduce the text frame via Format - Position and Size if it turned out much too large).  
Display area  
In this section of the dialog, you select what you want to insert into the current document.  
Link  
Mark this field if you want to insert the pages as a link.  
If this is the case, they will be updated automatically when the current document is reloaded if the original document has been changed.  
If this field is not marked, a copy of the pages is inserted.  
Duplicate Slide  
Use this command to create a copy of the current slide.  
The slide thus duplicated is inserted as a new slide directly after the original one.

Click here if you do not want to start the presentation with the first slide of the current document.  
Select the desired slide in the adjacent list box.  
Custom Slide Show  
If you previously defined a specific order for the slides with the menu command Custom Slide Show, you can select it here to run it as the current presentation.  
Type  
Here, you select the mode in which your presentation should run (e.g., fullscreen).  
Standard  
The default mode is a fullscreen presentation where the presentation runs through until the final slide, controlled by you.  
The black final slide only contains the request to complete the presentation with a click.  
You can also press any key instead.  
Window  
If you select this option, your presentation will not cover the full screen, but instead will run in the document window.  
If you inserted the presentation as a frame, in a text document for example, it will also run in the frame.  
Changing the document in another view during a presentation in the window can cause inconsistencies of both views.  
If you delete a document object, it may still be shown in the presentation since the bitmaps for the presentation were already computed.  
Auto  
The AutoMode is a fullscreen presentation that is repeated until you end it.  
You can end the automatic repeat by pressing the (Esc) key.  
In the respective spin button, you can adjust a time interval in seconds during which a pause slide is displayed between the individual runs of the presentation.  
After the set time has past, the presentation starts again from the beginning.  
Duration of pause  
Here, you determine the Duration of the pause between the repetitions of the presentation in the AutoMode.  
If you set the value to zero, no pause slide is displayed.  
Show logo  
If you click this check box, the %PRODUCTNAME logo will appear on the pause slide in AutoMode.  
Options  
During a presentation, the slides are usually always shown in the fullscreen mode.  
With the following options, you can determine how the presentation should be run.

Convert  
This is where you can open a submenu for converting the selected object.  
Convert to Curve  
Converts selected objects to Bézier curves.  
Convert to Polygon  
Converts an object to a polygon.  
The current look of the lines is not changed by the conversion, the extensive changes to the structure of the lines only become clear when you edit points.  
After conversion, the curve consists of numerous straight lines.  
You will only see the following dialog if you convert a bitmap (pixel graphic) into a polygon.  
Convert into polygon  
In addition to several preferences, the dialog box provides a preview of the expected result.  
Preferences  
This area provides the various available preferences for conversion.  
Number of colors:  
%PRODUCTNAME Draw generates a graphic consisting of polygons as a MetaFile.  
You can set the maximum number of color layers here.  
Point reduction  
All polygons are generated using the setting "0 pixels".  
If you enter a number, polygons for which the rectangle surrounding them contains fewer pixels than the number will not be generated.  
Fill holes  
It is possible that color layers will not be superimposed over each other precisely to the pixel.  
This option enables you to generate a background fill.  
This fill consists of individual rectangles whose size can be adjusted under Tile size.  
Tile size  
Here you can adjust the size of the rectangles for background fill for the Fill Holes option.  
Source picture:  
The selected source picture (bitmap) is shown in the window.  
Vectored image:  
You can display the result of your settings in this window with the Preview button.  
Progress  
The conversion progress appears here.  
Preview  
Click here to see a preview.  
Convert to 3D  
Here you convert the object into a three-dimensional view.  
The selection will be converted to a contour.  
This will also take line geometry into account.  
For example a contour will be converted into a three-dimensional object.  
if you selected several 2D objects simultaneously and converted them into 3D, you will obtain only one 3D object, the "scene".  
You can edit the scene by choosing Modify - Enter Group Format - Group - Edit Group or pressing (F3).  
You can also apply a different color, for example, to these objects.  
The easiest way to quit the scene is to click on Exit All Groups on the option bar.  
In addition to groups, you can also convert bitmap and metafile graphics directly into 3D objects.  
Bitmaps are placed on a correspondingly large rectangular object and then converted.  
The situation is different for metafiles, which are resolved into a group of polygons and are then converted.  
For simultaneous conversion of several objects, depth sorting used for 2D display is used as information for generating 3D objects of varying depths.  
The visibility that was present for 2D representation is then maintained.  
Even complex clipart objects can be converted relatively quickly.  
If you have drawing objects that contain text, the conversion takes place so that the text remains visible.  
Words cannot describe the limitless shape options available here.  
Give it a try, experiment with the tools, use the light effects, distortions, textures, 3D Effects etc.  
Convert to 3D Rotation Object  
Converts an object into a three dimensional rotation object.  
To Bitmap  
This is where you convert the object into a bitmap object (pixel graphics, grid graphics).  
Information on the bitmap format is in the Glossary.  
This function corresponds to copying the object to the clipboard and then pasting it as a bitmap (using the command Edit - Paste Special...).  
To metafile  
Use this command to convert the object into a metafile object (vector graphics) format.  
A brief explanation of the metafile format is in the Glossary.  
This functions corresponds to copying the object to the clipboard and then pasting it as a MetaFile object (by using the command Edit - Paste Special...).  
To Contour  
Use this command to convert the selected object into a group of polygons which contain the entire geometry of the object.  
When converting to contour the object itself, and text if entered together with the lines, line styles and arrowheads will be taken into account.  
This means that it is possible to create any type of arrow, convert it to a contour and edit it.  
Name  
Displays the Name dialog for naming the object.  
The object name you select is displayed in the Navigator, and on the status bar whenever you select the object.  
You can only assign names to OLE objects, grouped objects and imported graphics.  
This command is not available for other objects.  
Name  
40566Enter a name for the object in this text box.  
Combine  
Unlike Grouping, this action affects the attributes of the selected drawing element and the look of the drawing element created by combination.  
Depending on the arrangement of the selected drawing elements in relation to one another, new object contours are created and gaps may appear.  
Furthermore, the Combine command changes the drawing elements to Bézier curves.  
Split  
Use this command to split a drawing element created by combination (with Combine command) into individual components.  
The drawing elements created in this way appear as Bézier curves and have the properties of the combined object.  
Connect  
Use this command to create a new line object or Bézier curve from selected lines, parts of lines or BÃ©zier curves.  
If the objects to be combined do not actually touch each other, an additional connector will be created between the individual line segments.  
Break  
Use this command to break the bonds of previously connected (with Connect command) lines.  
The closed contour lines (polygons, bezier curves) of filled drawing elements are broken down into several individual lines and/or parts of Bézier curves.  
As there are no closed lines left after the break, you cannot fill in areas anymore.  
When a large metafile is to be broken up, a dialog appears enabling you to stop the process.  
Shapes  
This is where you open a submenu for applying one of three set operations to the polygons selected.  
Select all of the polygons to be edited and choose this command, found in the context menu of the selection and in %PRODUCTNAME Draw in the menu Modify.  
The polygons will be combined to a single polygon.  
This new polygon will then be given the attributes of the first polygon of the selection (the one at the back).  
Merge  
Merges the selected polygons (logical OR).  
Any holes contained in the polygons will be taken into account when being merged.  
This operation is not identical to Combine which depicts a logical XOR operation.  
Subtract  
Removes all other selected polygons from the bottommost polygon.  
This entails the other polygons first being merged and then subtracted from the polygon positioned under/behind all the others.  
Holes will be taken into account.  
Logically this operation corresponds to the following formula:  
A - (B1 _BAR_..... _BAR_ Bn)  
Cut  
The selected polygons will be turned into one single polygon corresponding to the intersection of all areas (Boolean AND).  
Only the area will remain in which all of the polygons overlap each other.  
Display Slide  
This is where you choose to show or not to show a slide in the slide show.  
Then choose Slide Show - Show/Hide Slide or click the Display Slide icon on the object bar.  
You can also find this command on the context menu of selected slides.  
The title of the slide (to the right under the slide) is highlighted with a gray background to show that this slide will no longer be displayed in the presentation.  
Choosing the menu item again or clicking the icon will remove the gray background and the slide will be displayed again.

This status bar field displays information about the position of the cursor and the size of the selected object.  
The measurement units correspond to the units on the rulers.  
They can be defined under Tools - Options - Presentation - General.  
Current Slide/Level  
In the normal mode, this status bar field displays the current page number.  
First the current page number is displayed, followed by the total number of pages, i.e., Page X/Y.  
If you have enabled Layer Mode, you will see the name of the layer in which each enabled object on the page is contained.  
Zoom  
The Zoom icon opens the Zoom floating toolbar which contains various icons used for defining the screen display.  
A short click calls the functions shown as an icon on the main toolbar.  
Zoom

Shift  
Click this icon to change the cursor to a hand which can then be used to shift the contents in the window.  
The document will follow the hand as if you are moving a piece of paper.  
As soon as you release the mouse button, the tool last used will be available again.  
Shift  
Effects  
The icon on the main toolbar opens the Effects window.  
Here you can edit objects with different effects.  
Effects  
Select the object or several objects.  
Under the Effects icon you will see several sub-icons.  
Holding the mouse button down, move to one of the icons and release the mouse button there to make this icon the current effects tool.  
It then replaces the previous Effects icon on the Drawings Toolbar.  
You can, however, also release the button and then drag the title bar of the window until a window outline follows the cursor.  
If you release the button now, you will see the freely movable Effects window.  
It remains on the screen until you close it explicitly, e.g., with the closing field.  
Rotate  
You can then move the cursor over one of the handles and it will change its appearance.  
Above the four corner handles, the mouse cursor has the form of an open circle arc; above the four center handles, it takes the form of a distortion cursor.  
At the center of the object, you see the pivot point, which you can move with the mouse.  
This is the point around which the object is rotated.  
There is only one pivot point per slide of your drawing or presentation.  
This has the advantage that you can rotate several objects (even subsequently inserted objects) around the common pivot point positioned once.  
If you double-click an object, the pivot point is placed in the center of this object.  
Rotate the object in the plane of the page by placing the cursor on one of the four corners and dragging it afterwards.  
Rotate in the third dimension perpendicular to the page by placing the cursor on one of the central handles of the four sides and dragging.  
When rotation in 3D, the handle on the side opposite the object temporarily becomes the pivot point.  
Rotate  
Flip  
Use this tool to flip the selected object.  
The flip line with points at each end appears.  
Using the mouse, you can drag these points to another place individually, or you can move the entire flip line, without changing the orientation, by clicking the object between the points and dragging it.  
You flip an object at the flip line by dragging one of its handles across the flip line and releasing it.  
Flip  
To 3D Rotation Object  
With this tool, you can transform a 2D object into a 3D rotation object.  
If a 2D object is selected, it can be rotated around the rotation axis so that a 3D rotation object is created.  
Draw a 2D object, a Bézier curve of half of the outline of a chessman, for example.  
Click on To 3D Rotation Object.  
You will now see a symmetry axis, which you can move with the mouse.  
At the ends of the symmetry axis, you will see small circles, which you can also move with the mouse to change the angle of the axis.  
Now move the axis a bit or further until you see a dashed mirror image of the 2D object on the other side of the axis.  
It is converted into a 3D object.+  
If they overlap, no 3D object will be created.  
To 3D Rotation Object  
Set in Circle (perspective)  
With this tool, you set the selected object perspectively on a circle.  
The cursor will look like a crown.  
Now drag in various directions while pressing the left mouse button to see what happens to the delimiting frame of the object.  
When you release the button, the object conforms to the delimiting frame.  
Set in circle (perspective)  
Set in Circle (slant)  
With this tool, you slant the marked object and set it in a circle.  
It is used in the same way as the perspective setting in a circle described above.  
Set in circle (slant)  
Distort  
Choose this tool for distorting the marked object.  
Distorting is only possible with polygons or Bézier curves.  
If the object to be distorted is not available as a polygon or Bézier curve, you will be asked if you want to transform the object.  
Though this was not possible with slanting, here you can change the edge length of the object when you distort.  
Distort  
Transparency  
This tool can be used to interactively define a transparency gradient.  
The gradient behaves like a color gradient with grayscale values, where black corresponds to a value of 0% transparency and white to a value of 100% transparency.  
All colors that you apply, for example, from the Color bar using Drag & Drop are converted automatically to grayscales, which define the level of transparency.  
Click outside the selected object to apply the gradient and to exit this mode.  
Use the Undo function if you do not want to apply the gradient.  
Note:  
The transparency effect is only visible if a background or object is located behind the transparent object.  
Transparency  
Gradient  
This tool can be used to interactively alter a color gradient for a selected object that already has a gradient.  
The existing color gradient (see Format - Area - Gradients) offers options for determining the manner in which you can make changes interactively.  
Depending on the type of gradient, you can edit the vector and the color objects.  
For example, you can drag colors using drag & drop from the Color Bar and drop them onto the color objects.  
Click outside the selected object to apply the gradient and to exit this mode.  
Use the Undo function if you do not want to apply the gradient.  
When you invoke this tool, you will see two color objects in the selected object, which are linked by means of a vector.  
Depending on the type of color gradient, you can move one or both color objects.  
You can change the color of each color object by dragging a color from the Color Bar (View - Toolbars - Color Bar) and dropping it onto a color object.  
Gradient  
Object Bar Edit Glue Points  
This object bar becomes visible when you have clicked the icon Edit Glue Points located on the options bar.  
Glue points are user-defined points where the Connectors are positioned.  
In addition there are the four default glue points located in the middle of each of the sides of the surrounding rectangle.  
Insert Glue Point  
Click here to insert additional glue points.  
You will then be able to set a new glue point at the required position in the area of the selected object every time you click the mouse button.  
Click on this icon again to exit insert glue points.

Curves  
The Curves floating toolbar contains symbols for drawing lines.  
If you hold the Shift key down, the movement of the mouse is limited to multiples of 45 degrees.  
This allows you to create objects that consist of curves that are not connected together.  
If you draw a smaller object while holding down the Options Alt key into a larger object that you have not closed yet, the smaller object is subtracted from the larger one, thus appearing as a hole in the larger one.  
Curve, filled  
Use this icon to define a filled, freeform Bézier curve.  
Click the icon, then define a curve in your document by clicking three times to create three support points.  
This will draw a Bézier curve that follows the movement of the mouse as closely as possible.  
You can also define data points alternately by clicking and can specify other portions of the curve by dragging with the mouse.  
It is automatically filled with the current fill color.  
You can also use the context menu of the curve to select a gradient, a bitmap or hatching as fill.  
Curve, filled  
Polygon, filled  
Use this icon to define a filled polygon.  
After clicking this icon you should then define the points of your polygon by first drawing a line to join the first two points.  
Further points can be added by clicking into the document.  
The points will be connected by a straight line.  
It is filled in automatically.  
Polygon, filled  
Polygon (45°), filled  
Click here to draw a filled polygon.  
The angles can only be multiples of 45 degrees with the exception of the last line that closes the polygon.  
Click the icon and define the breaking points for the polygon by clicking on various positions of the document.  
The points will be then connected by straight lines.  
It is filled in automatically.

3D Objects  
The 3D Objects floating toolbar helps you draw 3D objects.  
Select the 3D tool from the floating toolbar and then drag open a frame the size of the desired object on the page.  
When you release the mouse button, the 3D object appears.  
3D objects are always created with sides of equal length, e.g. as cube or sphere.  
If you do not want this, press the Shift key when opening the object the first time.  
3D objects  
3D objects can be positioned and rotated anywhere in the space.  
To rotate, use the Rotate tool on the Effects floating toolbar.  
Cube

Connector  
A connector is used to combine objects with a line.  
If you move the objects, the connector is adjusted automatically.  
When you copy connected lines, the connectors are also copied.  
Connector  
Click the icon.  
The mouse pointer now contains the symbol of the connector until you exit connector mode again.  
You can now connect two objects with a line by dragging with the mouse from one object to the other.  
Various options are available under Format - Connector for modifying the connector properties later.  
Otherwise you must place the mouse pointer on the border of the object.  
Now you can see that the object is flashing at regular intervals.  
Hold down the mouse button and drag to the other object.  
The object here is flashing either inside or on the border.  
Release the mouse button and the two objects will be connected.  
In the method described above, %PRODUCTNAME searches for the optimal point among the four midpoints of the surrounding rectangle for gluing the connector.  
To determine the side to which the connector is glued yourself, move the mouse pointer precisely to the center of the side corresponding to the surrounding rectangle.  
A small square will then flash here.  
This procedure for gluing the connector in the middle of the page of the surrounding rectangle can only be used for rectangular objects, however.  
For ellipses or other irregular objects, the connector is usually placed incorrectly on the surrounding rectangle.  
Then you can define any glue points you want to which the connector can be glued within the surrounding rectangle with the glue point editor, which you will find on the Effects floating toolbar.  
Connectors can be edited (modify line style, line ends and color) - see Object Bar) and deleted (select and press the (Del) key).

Converting to Curves, Polygons, 3D  
You can edit many objects quite effectively by converting them.  
Let's look at a simple example to illustrate this:  
Open a rectangle.  
This has the default settings for color, line thickness etc. and should now be selected.  
Choose Modify - Convert (in %PRODUCTNAME Impress you will find the corresponding command on the context menu of the rectangle).  
You will see the menu subcommands To Curve, To Polygon, To 3D, To 3D Rotation Object.  
Choose Modify - Convert - To Curve to convert the rectangle into a Bézier curve.  
You can now edit the existing points.  
You can move the points, convert them from corner points into rounded points, delete them, insert new points etc.  
All these options are described in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help under the search words Edit points and Bézier object bar.  
Choose Modify - Convert - To Polygon to convert the original rectangle into a "Polygon with 4 points", as will then be stated on the status bar.  
You can now, for example, break a polygon down into its basic parts by choosing Break from the Modify menu.  
The status bar will then read "4 Lines selected".  
You can shift each of the lines separately.  
With the polygon selected, you can also click the Edit Points icon to modify points, insert new ones and so on.  
Choose Modify - Convert - To 3D to generate a three-dimensional object by so-called extrusion of the two-dimensional object.  
The polygon is "pulled" perpendicular to its plane by a certain amount into the third dimension.  
You can rotate the 3D object and edit it with the help of the 3D Effects window that is called up via the context menu.  
Choose Modify - Convert - To 3D Rotation Object to create a 3D object by means of a rotation extrusion.  
A polygon will be rotated 360 degrees around an axis into the third dimension.  
If you rotate the rectangle a little bit before converting it into a 3D rotation object, a more striking object will be created.  
Creating Animated GIF Images  
You can create animated pictures, i.e. cartoons, and insert and run them in your presentations.  
The %PRODUCTNAME Impress animation format is provided for this purpose.  
In addition, you can display animated GIF images by dragging them directly from the Gallery theme "Animated GIFs" into your document.  
Animated GIFs are excellent ways of catching the eye on Internet pages and other presentations.  
An animated GIF picture is a sequence of pixel pictures that are assigned in a single file and use space efficiently.  
They are loaded once and can then be displayed by a program capable of playing animated GIFs, such as most Web browsers and %PRODUCTNAME too.  
The pictures appear like little cartoons if the animated GIFs are defined so that several pictures are displayed per second in continual repetition.  
To compile an animation, all individual pictures must be drawn first.  
For our demonstration we will use cross-fading so that you do not have to draw all the individual pictures.  
The following example uses cross-fading to quickly and easily use ten or more individual pictures for the animation.  
Since cross-fading is possible only in %PRODUCTNAME Draw and animation only in %PRODUCTNAME Impress, a drawing document and presentation document must be used for this example.  
Open a new, empty drawing document (New - Drawing).  
For example, draw a red rectangle at the upper left and a green circle at the lower right.  
Select both objects together (press Shift key).  
Choose Edit - Cross-Fading.  
In the dialog, select 8 Increments and Cross-fade attributes.  
Click OK.  
10 objects that make up one group will appear.  
Leave the grouping as is if that is what you want.  
However, if you want the animated GIF picture to display a centered object that fills the picture and changes form and color but does not move from top left to bottom right, then you must remove the grouping (in the Modify menu).  
For this example, we removed the grouping (Modify - Remove Grouping).  
Copy all individual pictures together (they are still selected together) to the clipboard.  
Switch to an empty %PRODUCTNAME Impress presentation document.  
Insert the contents from the clipboard.  
Now you will continue working in %PRODUCTNAME Impress after you have created the individual pictures.  
Choose Slide Show - Animation.  
This opens the Animation dialog.  
Select the Bitmap Object option.  
GIF pictures are bitmap or pixel images.  
All individual objects are still selected together (and overlap in the correct sequence).  
Click the Assign Objects Individually icon.  
After a short delay the 10 individual objects were transferred as bitmaps in the 10 pictures for animation.  
The last or bottom object in the stack became Picture 1 and the top one became Picture 10.  
You can view the result in the dialog (Play icon).  
For the animation to run really smoothly, it would be better to run it from image 10 thru 9, 8 and so on back to image 2.  
Then the whole sequence begins again, starting from image 1.  
To achieve this, proceed as follows:  
1.  
Make sure that Picture 10 is the active picture in the Animation dialog (Last Picture icon).  
Select the second to last object before the green circle (object from Picture 9) in the presentation document (do not change anything in the Animation dialog!).  
Click the Insert Object icon in the Animation dialog.  
2.  
Select the next object (Object from Picture 8) and click Insert Object in the Animation dialog.  
Repeat these steps until Object from Picture 2, the second object at the top left.  
3.  
You can now insert the completed animation into the page by clicking the Create button.  
4.  
The animated bitmap object will appear in the middle of the page.  
Drag the object to a free space and remove the selection by clicking a different area.  
The object will be displayed with animation.  
Editing Animated GIFs  
To edit the individual images of an animated GIF, load the animated GIF on a %PRODUCTNAME Impress page and open the Animation window (Slide Show - Animation).  
Apply the objects with the Apply Objects Individually icon.  
Delete all pictures except for the individual picture and click Create.  
The individual picture can be edited on the %PRODUCTNAME Impress page.  
Next, delete the contents of the Animation window, apply the entire animation again in the window, switch to the individual picture in the Animation window, delete the picture and apply the selected individual picture from the %PRODUCTNAME Impress page.  
Saving Animations as GIF Files  
Select the animated object.  
Choose the File - Export command.  
The Export dialog appears.  
Select GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) as the file type.  
Check the Selection check box to export only the select object to a file, not the entire page.  
Specify a location and name for the animated GIF file.  
Click Save.  
Animated GIF files - and other graphics - can be embedded in your documents (Insert - Graphics).  
You can also organize your animated GIFs in the Gallery.  
Drag the object into a theme folder of the Gallery.  
Animating Objects in Slides  
The effects that are used to cross-fade from one slide to another in a presentation can also be used for fading in individual objects or groups of objects.  
In the following example, you'll see how to create a slide with a title that "falls" into position from above, followed by a rectangle that slides into the picture along a defined arc.  
1.  
Open a new presentation document.  
2.  
Click on the Text icon on the main toolbar, then click in the document and type your text.  
Format the text the way you want it.  
3.  
Choose Slide Show - Effects.  
Select one of the illustrated effects ("Uncover From Top").  
4.  
Click on the Assign icon.  
5.  
Click in the Preview window to see the actual effect.  
With a plain text object (i.e., an object created with the Text tool) the Effects and Text Effects icons have the same result.  
In contrast, with a rectangle or other object that you have typed text into, you can assign different effects for the object and accompanying text.  
1.  
Draw a rectangle and assign a color to it.  
2.  
Next, draw a freeform line from the floating toolbar Curves & Polygons.  
3.  
Select the line and the rectangle together with the Select tool and Shift.  
4.  
Choose Slide Show - Effects.  
5.  
In the dialog, click the Effects icon.  
6.  
In the list box select "Other", then click Along Curve.  
7.  
Click Assign, and if you wish, click the Preview.  
8.  
If you have several objects with effects on one slide, you can click the respective object in the preview window in order to see the effect.  
9.  
View the presentation by clicking the Slide Show icon on the main toolbar.  
If you marked the Change slides manually check box in the Slide Show Settings - Slide Show dialog, you need to click the mouse button every time to change the slide.  
Within this dialog, every effect is a "slide transition".  
Animating Slide Transitions  
1.  
Create a few slides with objects on them.  
You can create new slides by clicking in the area next to the tabs at the bottom of the work area.  
2.  
If you drew the slides for a presentation, switch to the Slide View (View - Master View - Slides View or click the Slide View icon on the right hand edge of the window).  
3.  
You now see an overview of the slides.  
Use the Zoom icon to display the overview on different scales.  
4.  
Select a slide and open the Slide Show - Slide Transition dialog (or Slide Transition in the context menu for the selected slide).  
This opens the Slide Transition dialog.  
In this dialog, select the effect leading up to the display of the selected slide, that is to say, that appears before the selected slide becomes fully visible.  
5.  
You can also select the effects on the Slide Object Bar, where you will find various list boxes, icons and spin buttons for setting the effects.  
The settings you make here are applied immediately, without you having to click first on Assign.  
6.  
Select an effect from the extensive list of effects, and click on Assign.  
Do the same for the other slides that are to have effects.  
On the left, underneath each slide to be displayed with an effect, is a small button which you can click to run a preview of the effect on the slide table.  
Slide Transition  
Arranging Slides  
Switch to the Slide View by clicking the respective icon above the vertical scroll bar located at the right of your screen.  
Now you can rearrange the position of individual slides and define effects for the transition between slides.  
In the slide view, change the sequence of the slides by dragging them to any other position in the presentation.  
The mouse pointer will have a small plus sign next to it while you drag to indicate a copy.  
You can also drag and drop between the slide views of %PRODUCTNAME Impress documents.  
If you call up the context menu of a selected slide, you will see the Show/Hide Slide command.  
You can use this command to temporarily remove the current slide from your presentation, without deleting it from the actual document.  
A slide that is not shown in the presentation receives a name highlighted in gray.  
Master View  
Defining Background Colors  
You can draw and create the background of a slide in a presentation or drawing document either in the master view or by assigning another Page Style to the slides.  
Switch to the master view using the icon in the lower left-hand corner of the work area.  
In the master view, you can edit the background for all slides.  
All objects that you enter in this view, whether company logos, lines or text, are displayed in the background on all slides that use the current Page Style (the masterpage).  
This allows you to reproduce headers and footers on presentation slides.  
The objects that you insert in the Master View cannot be modified in the normal Slide View.  
If you want to give a uniform texture to the background, this is also possible without having to go into the Master View:  
Choose Format - Slide - Background tab.  
Select a color, gradient, hatching or bitmap for the background.  
When you quit the dialog, you are asked if the settings should apply to all slides or just to the current slide.  
If you answer "Yes" to the question "Background settings for all slides?", the Background Presentation Style will be modified for the current master page.  
All slides that use the same Page Style will have the modified background.  
If you answer "No", only the background of the current slide will be modified.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Impress you can modify the Presentation Styles in the Stylist by following these steps:  
In the Stylist, click the Presentation Styles icon, if it is not already selected.  
Now you can see all existing Styles of this type in the Stylist.  
Click the Background Style.  
Open the context menu for this Style and choose Modify.  
In the dialog that then appears, select a suitable color for the background of all slides with the current Page Style.  
Click OK.  
Note that this modification is only valid for the current presentation document.  
Zooming With Keys  
You can use the numeric keypad to quickly enlarge, reduce or reset the view of a graphic or presentation to its original scale without having to access the menus or dialog boxes.  
With the (-) key you can reduce the view, and with the (+) key you can enlarge it.  
The view will change by one step every time you press the key until you reach the limits of the scale.  
Using the key directly next to the minus key, which on most keyboards is represented by the multiplication sign (x), you can reset the view to 1:1.  
Shortcut keys for presentations  
Exporting Presentations as HTML Files  
Open the presentation that you would like to export in HTML format.  
Choose File - Export.  
This opens the Export dialog.  
Under File type, Web page is already selected.  
Enter a File name and click Save.  
This opens the HTML Export Autopilot.  
This AutoPilot takes you through a series of dialogs.  
HTML Export AutoPilot  
File - Export  
Importing HTML Pages Into Presentations  
You can import any text page, including pages in HTML format, into a %PRODUCTNAME Impress slide.  
Go to the slide where you want to insert the text or HTML page.  
Choose Insert - File.  
This opens the Insert File dialog.  
Under File Type, select "Text" or "Web page".  
Select the file to be inserted and click Insert.  
If the file contains more text than can be inserted in one slide, spread the text over several slides:  
Double-click in the inserted text, to see the gray edge that indicates edit mode.  
Select all the text underneath the visible slide and cut it to the clipboard by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (X).  
Insert a new, blank slide and paste the content of the clipboard there by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (V).  
Repeat these steps until all the text is placed on slides.  
Individual Presentations  
You can show your slides from beginning to end, for example by clicking the Slide Show icon on the main toolbar, or with the keyboard shortcut (Command) (Ctrl) (F2).  
Usually, a presentation always starts with the first slide.  
To begin with the current slide, proceed as follows:  
Choose Tools - Options - Presentation - General.  
In the area Starting the presentation mark the Always with current slide check box.  
Note that this setting has priority over the Individual Presentation described below.  
You have other options to show only or never show certain slides:  
If you do not wish to show a slide, go to the Slide View (for example by choosing View - Master View - Slides View), select the slide and select Slide Show - Show/Hide Slide.  
The name of the selected slide will now appear highlighted in gray, meaning that the slide will not be shown.  
Choose Presentation - Show/Hide Slide again when you want to have the slide shown again.  
A more elegant way to keep individual slides hidden in certain presentations can be found under Presentation - Custom Slide Shows.  
In the Custom Slide Shows dialog, click the New button.  
The Define Custom Slide Show dialog appears.  
In this dialog, enter a name for your presentation.  
Select a slide you want to show in your custom slide show and click the button with the arrows pointing to the right.  
The slide will be inserted in the right field.  
All slides listed on the right will be shown in the custom slide show.  
You can rearrange the order of your slides in the right field via Drag&Drop.  
Moving Objects to Another Layer  
To move an object from one level to another, select the object and drag it with Drag&Drop to the tab on the other level.  
After the first click hold the mouse steady for a moment before moving the mouse cursor so the object can be included in the Drag&Drop clipboard.  
Inserting Layers  
Switch to the Layer View, for example by clicking on the Layer View icon in the icon group at the bottom left of the working area, or by choosing View - Layer.  
At the bottom of the work area, you can see the sheet tab of the selected layer.  
Though this layer can be used, it cannot be renamed or deleted.  
Click in the area next to the tab or select Insert - Layer in the context menu of the sheet tab.  
This opens the Insert Layer dialog.  
At the same time you can decide whether the layer should be visible, printable or locked.  
Click OK.  
The new layer automatically becomes the active layer, and all objects now appear on the new layer.  
Using Layers  
On the pages of drawing and presentation documents, you can work with different layers, some of which can be hidden, prevented from printing or safeguarded against further editing.  
This means that you can always see all the layers on each slide.  
You can make each individual layer invisible, and so hide it from view.  
Working with layers is like putting your objects on top of each other on transparent overhead sheets.  
On the other hand, layers in %PRODUCTNAME are not quite the same, because in %PRODUCTNAME the layers do not define the sequence of objects when they are overlaid.  
Instead, the sequence of overlaid objects within the stack is a property of each individual object.  
It is not dependent on the layer containing the objects.  
Every slide of your drawing or presentation can contain several layers, which in turn contain various objects.  
Each layer always appears on all slides, and the background can also contain several layers.  
Suppose you are drawing the outline of a house, for example.  
On slide 1 you draw the ground floor, on slide 2 the top floor and on slide 3 the cellar.  
You might draw the walls with openings for doors and windows at ground level, that is to say, where you would draw them if you didn't know about the layering mode (or if it wasn't turned on).  
This level has the name Layout.  
Alternatively, for the walls, you could define a new level with the name "Walls".  
Next, define a layer for the electrical wiring, named "Electricity".  
This layer is valid for all slides, but on each slide you can arrange different objects on the "Electricity" layer.  
Since all the layers are transparent, this does not affect the visibility of other layers.  
You can draw the plumbing on another layer, named "Water".  
Now, specify whether to view and print all layers of the house plan, only one layer, or any combination of layers.  
However, visibility (or invisibility) and printability of a layer applies to all slides.  
Since you began with the walls and continued with the electrical wiring and plumbing, the pipes and wiring are positioned above the walls layer.  
You can determine the stacking order of selected objects via the icons on the Arrange floating toolbar.  
Working with layers  
Changing layers  
Change to another layer by switching to layer view (View - Layer) and then clicking on the tab for the layer.  
Hiding layers  
You can make a layer visible or invisible by clicking on its tab while holding down the Shift key.  
The names of all invisible layers appear in blue.  
Locking layers  
To prevent the objects on a layer from being modified, lock the layer.  
If you want to edit these objects, the protection must be removed before modifying objects or inserting new ones.  
Drawing Curves  
You will find the tools for drawing special shapes in the Curves floating toolbar.  
Drag the floating toolbar away from the Main toolbar into an empty drawing or presentation document.  
Select the Curve icon.  
The cursor appears as a cross-hair symbol with an accompanying symbol that indicates the new function.  
You can now create a curve with the mouse.  
The point where you first click the mouse button determines the starting point.  
The direction in which the point where you release the mouse button lies, defines the direction the curve takes from the starting point.  
Now, move the mouse without holding the button down - the curve will follow the movement of the mouse - and click where the second point of the curve should be.  
If you keep holding down the mouse button, you can define the direction of the curve from the second point to the next point (just as you did from the starting point), release the mouse and move to the third point, click again and keep the mouse button pressed, and so on.  
But when you release the mouse button after clicking on the second point of the curve, and then click on another point in the slide, the second point is defined as a corner point.  
At a corner point, the curve abruptly changes direction, thus forming a corner.  
If you also define point three as a corner point in this way, you will obtain a straight section between points two and three.  
When you hold down the Shift key, the directions will be limited to multiples of 45 degrees.  
When you hold down the Option Alt key, the curve closes, and you can draw an additional curve, which you can combine with the first one to form a single object.  
To end curve drawing, double-click the last point to be set.  
You can now continue working with other tools.  
The curves you have drawn are Bézier curves.  
The points on a Bézier curve are called data points.  
Each data point on the Bézier curve can be "symmetric".  
The curve then has the same curvature either side of the point.  
The curve then has different curvatures either side of the point.  
If the curve is not steadily continued at the data point, but instead forms a corner or tip, it is a corner point.  
You can convert any type into any other, giving you great control over the shape of the curve.  
How can I link two existing points in a drawing using lines?  
To precisely link two points within a drawing using lines, click the Line icon on the main toolbar and also activate the option bar via View - Toolbars - Option Bar.  
Select the Snap to Object Points icon on this toolbar.  
Editing Curves  
You can edit the data points if they are displayed as small rectangles.  
If you want to work on a curve later, when it is no longer activated, click the Edit Points icon on the object bar and select the curve.  
If the object bar is not visible, click briefly on Select on the main toolbar:  
Now click Edit Points on the far left of the object bar or on the option bar.  
Click once on the point you want to edit.  
It will appear as a filled square, and you will see two Bézier lines with control points at the ends. (Please note that sometimes one of the control points is directly on top of the Bézier point and thus hard to see.) In the case of corner points which define right angles, the control points lie directly on the Bézier point.  
You may now move the Bézier point and the control points as you wish.  
Note how the curve changes accordingly.  
The change in form of the cursor indicates in each case the function that can be executed.  
The object bar contains several icons with which you can, among other options, change the type of the selected point.  
A detailed explanation of the various options can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
If you want to convert the type of data point, select the point.  
The object bar shows the type of point: corner point, smooth transition or symmetric transition.  
Click one of the icons to change the type of point.  
Of course, you can also edit curves in the "conventional" manner, i.e., changing width, color, and (in the case of a filled curve) the object fill.  
However, if the Edit points icon is not pressed you can use the context menu or the Format and Modify menus.  
Also try out the other icons on the Curves floating toolbar.  
When you finish a filled curve by double-clicking, it is automatically closed and all "internal areas" are filled.  
Object bar  
Live Mode  
Rounding off the final details of your presentations is an easy task in %PRODUCTNAME, thanks to the unique Live Mode facility.  
A "proper" presentation needs to be shown in Full Screen mode, therefore this is the "default".  
However, to edit the presentation, you need to be in window mode, so that you can see all the facilities, menus and icons.  
In window mode the proportions and overall impression are quite different than in Full Screen mode.  
Live Mode resolves this dilemma.  
Create a new presentation or open an existing one.  
For this example, a single slide with one object will do.  
Choose Slide Show - Slide Show Settings to set the type of presentation.  
The individual options are described in detail in %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Start the presentation with default settings by clicking the Slide Show icon on the main toolbar.  
When you see the first slide (or the slide on which you want to make changes), open the Navigator by pressing (F5).  
In the Navigator, click the Live Mode icon.  
Now you can move, edit or modify all objects on the slide.  
To move objects, you can simply drag and drop them with the mouse.  
You can change other properties in the context menu for the selected object.  
You can see the changes directly in the presentation environment, in Full Screen.  
Turn off Live Mode in the Navigator before ending the presentation.  
While Live Mode is switched on, you cannot end or cancel the presentation.

Switching Page Styles  
The subordinate designs which make up the slide design determine the way an object looks, including its background.  
The slide design can also be called a "Master Slide".  
In %PRODUCTNAME Impress, you can assign a different slide design to each slide if you want.  
Go to the slide that is to have a different Masterpage.  
Select Format - Styles - Slide Design....  
You will see the Slide Design dialog.  
You will see the Load Slide Design dialog.  
Select a new slide design on the dialog, e.g. from the area "Presentation Backgrounds" and confirm this with OK.  
Notice the Exchange background page check box.  
If it doesn't have a check mark in it, then it will only apply to the current slide.  
This gives you the flexibility to define a different slide design, and thus a different background, for example, for one single slide.  
The background you have selected will now be assigned to the slide currently in use.  
Stylist  
Moving Objects With Millimeter Accuracy  
Use the arrow keys to move a selected object short distances exactly horizontally or vertically.  
Press one of the four arrow keys to move the object one millimeter.  
Creating Flowcharts  
1.  
First, open a new drawing document (File - New - Drawing).  
2.  
Draw a rectangle as a text box, which can contain names and job titles, for example.  
The objects can also be displayed with shadows.  
3.  
In order to make all the boxes the same size, simply use the command in the Edit menu to duplicate the first one.  
Choose a suitable placement setting in the X or Y axis fields to make it easier to generate the next box.  
Not only is the duplicated box itself copied, but also the route and direction to the previous box.  
4.  
Arrange the boxes next to each other, or above one another, so that each is centrally aligned.  
To do this, click each of the boxes while holding down the Shift key and choose the command Alignment - Middle from the context menu or the Alignment floating toolbar.  
5.  
Simply double-click in a box and type your text.  
To insert a line break, hold down the Shift key and press Enter.  
6.  
You can also connect boxes to show a hierarchical relationship.  
Choose the type of connector from the Connectors floating toolbox that you wish to use between two boxes.  
If you then position the mouse pointer over a box (without clicking) you will notice that the border of the box begins to blink.  
Press the mouse button and move the mouse to another box to attach the first anchor of the connector to the entire object.  
If, however, you point to one of the four gluepoints in the middle of the object edges, only this point will blink.  
Drag from here to another object to attach the connector to precisely this point.  
You will see the difference from the first method if you move one of the objects around the other.  
If the connector is fastened to the entire object, it will always use the gluepoint closest to the other object.  
In the second method, the connector remains on the selected gluepoint.  
Decide on a method and then drag the mouse from one object to the other.  
At the target object, decide whether you want to fasten the connector to a certain gluepoint or to the whole object.  
With circles, ellipses, and 3-D objects, the four gluepoints are located in the middle of each side of the blinking box that appears around the object when you attempt to anchor the connector.  
For such objects you should define your own gluepoints.  
You can choose where you want the gluepoint to be - either on the edge or in the interior.  
1.  
To set a glue point, open the option bar (View - Toolbars - Option Bar).  
Click on the Edit Glue Points icon.  
This opens the Glue Point Object Bar (if you want you can pull this into a free window and dock it again).  
2.  
Click on Insert Glue Point.  
The mouse pointer indicates its new function.  
3.  
If no object is selected, click on an object to specify where the gluepoint should be attached.  
This is necessary since gluepoints can also be placed outside the object (though they must lie within the border).  
4.  
Click where you want to place the gluepoint, and a small x will appear.  
5.  
You now have the option of beginning and ending connectors at this glue point.  
Options).  
You may click on gluepoints at any time in order to move them.  
A connector can also be activated by clicking it.  
You can also change the type of connector or, for curved connectors, change the horizontal or vertical course.

Converting Text Characters to Curves  
Type the text, letters or special characters in a %PRODUCTNAME Draw document.  
Select an adequate font size and a suitable font type, so that you do not have to do an unnecessary amount of editing.  
To enter text, use the Text icon from the Text floating toolbar on the main toolbar.  
With the text object still selected, choose the command Modify - Convert to Curve.  
The text is converted to a vector object that can be edited.  
If your text consists of more than one character, the characters will be displayed as a grouped object.  
To edit a single character, you have to enter the group.  
To do this, use the Enter Group command in the context menu of the group or press F3.

Vectorizing Bitmaps  
With %PRODUCTNAME Impress or %PRODUCTNAME Draw, you can also transform pixel images, so called bitmaps, into vector drawings.  
One of the advantages of vector graphics is that they look good in any scale when printed.  
This is different when printing scaled bitmaps, since unattractive effects may appear, such as missing or zigzag lines, etc.  
1.  
Select the bitmap you want to vectorize, for example by clicking once on the object.  
2.  
Choose Convert - To Polygon.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Impress from the context menu of the selected object.  
In the Convert to Polygon dialog you can set some parameters for the conversion and preview the result.

Object Bar in the Slide View  
The %PRODUCTNAME Impress object bar in the Slide View enables you to, among other things, select among the various transition effects.  
The main toolbar in the Slide View also offers you a zoom tool and a selection tool for viewing slides and sorting them using drag and drop.  
Status Bar  
The status bar contains several buttons with special functions and information about the document currently opened.  
Rulers  
The rulers on the left and upper margins of the %PRODUCTNAME Impress document window inform you about the dimensions of the slide and the position and size of the object currently selected.  
The rulers are switched on and off by choosing View - Rulers.  
The measurement units of the rulers are determined by using the context menu that is called up when positioned on one of the rulers and then pressing Crtl while right- clicking with the mouse.  
You are able to read off the measurements of a selected object by consulting the markings on the rulers.  
If you grabbed such a marking with the mouse and drag it, you can alter the size of the object.  
The slide margins can also be modified by dragging the margins of the white area in the rulers.  
To have a different origin for the co-ordinates shown other than the top left corner of a slide (taking slide margins into account), you should drag the point of intersection (button at convergence point of both rulers in the top left corner) of both rulers to another location.  
The point of origin can be returned to the top left corner by double clicking on the point of intersection button.  
Drag a line out of the rulers to determine where the snap lines are to be located.  
If a text object is being edited then its tabulators will be displayed and can be modified in the ruler.  
The Main Toolbar in the Drawing, Notes and Handout Views  
This dockable toolbar contains the most important editing tools.  
Many of the icons display floating toolbars containing additional icons.  
Icons under which floating toolbars are found have a small triangle on the icon button.  
Long-click an icon to open the floating toolbar.  
Select Objects  
Objects can be selected by clicking them with the selection tool.  
If the Shift key is held down whilst clicking on several objects then they will all be selected together.  
If several objects overlap then press and hold the Option Alt key and click to select the objects in the back.  
Each click selects the next object, use Shift + Option Alt to select the previous object instead.  
Most of the editing tools affect selected objects which are denoted by eight small handles.  
When you double click a selected object, the handles increase to show that text linked to the object can now be entered.  
To remove the selection, click outside of the selected object at any time.  
Rotate  
This tool is used to rotate the object.  
It corresponds to the command Rotate found on the %PRODUCTNAME Draw Main Toolbar under Effects.

Functionality of %PRODUCTNAME Impress  
We give you a brief overview here of some important functions and capabilities of %PRODUCTNAME Impress.  
There are even more features, for example, quick text entry, text structuring and positioning in frames, on objects, as legends, etc.  
Designing Vector Graphics  
In %PRODUCTNAME Impress nearly all the tools found in %PRODUCTNAME Draw for creating vector graphics are at your disposal.  
Present slide shows  
%PRODUCTNAME Impress can manage almost any number of slides in each document.  
Each slide represents one screen or overhead projector sheet of your presentation.  
Templates in %PRODUCTNAME Impress enable you to have a uniform format for your slides.  
The slide shows in %PRODUCTNAME Impress can be made less monotonous by employing some of the many effects available.  
Choose from the numerous cross-fading effects supplied, set the on-screen duration for each slide, select a sound effect or assign animation effects to any object on any or all pages which are called up by mouse click, for example.  
Develop Presentations  
There are also other features in %PRODUCTNAME Impress which can help you create your presentations easily and quickly.  
In the Slide view you can see an overview of all the slides, which can then be rearranged, copied, cut and pasted using Drag&Drop even beyond the visible area.  
Use the Notes view to note texts that are also important but which are not to be visible during the presentation, and print accompanying material for your viewers in the Handout view.  
If you rehearse the running time of your presentation you can automatically stop the time and, for example, enter the time required to read out the text for each slide.  
Publishing Presentations  
With the aid of a special AutoPilot, you can export your presentation to be published in the Internet.  
All the necessary conversions are done automatically.  
The presentation you export can be viewed with any modern browser.  
Performing Live Presentations  
If you want you can draw on a slide with the mouse during a presentation to underscore important points as if you were using a highlighter.  
In the live mode, you can modify, delete or add objects to your slides while the presentation is running.

When entering information manually in the command window, note that a number of operators require spaces for the correct structure.  
This is especially true if you are working with values instead of placeholders, e.g. for the "is considerably greater" relation, enter either 10 gg 1 or a gg b.  
Operators  
You can choose among various operators to structure your %PRODUCTNAME Math formula.  
All available operators appear in the lower part of the Selection window.  
They are also listed in the context menu of the Commands window.  
All operators not contained in the Selection window or in the context menu must be entered manually in the Commands window.  
An icon next to the operator name indicates that it can be accessed via the Selection window (choose View - Selection) or via the context menu of the Commands window.  
Operator Functions:  
Limes  
Inserts the limes character with a placeholder.  
You can also enter lim<?>directly in the Commands window.

You can also enter llint<?>directly in the Commands window.  
Triple Curve Integral  
Inserts a triple curve integral symbol with one placeholder.  
You can also enter lllint<?>directly in the Commands window.  
Upper Limit  
Inserts the range statement upper limit for integral and sum with placeholders You can also enter to<?><?>directly in the Commands window.  
Limit statements can only be used if related with the appropriate operators.  
Or you can supply an operator, e.g. an integral, with limits (placeholders); this is faster than entering the command in the Commands window.  
Click the desired integral and then the symbol for the limits.  
You can also enter liminf<?>directly in the Commands window.  
You can also enter limsup<?>directly in the Commands window.  
By entering oper in the Commands window, you can insert user-defined operators in %PRODUCTNAME Math, a feature useful for incorporating special characters in a formula.  
Such an entry could be oper %theta x.  
Using the oper command, you can also insert characters not in the default %PRODUCTNAME character set. oper can also be used in connection with limits, e.g. oper %union from {i=1} to n x_{i}.  
In this example, the union symbol is indicated by the name union.  
However, this is not one of the predefined symbols.  
To define it yourself, choose Tools - Symbols - Catalog.  
Click the Edit button in the dialog that appears, then select Special as symbol set.  
Enter a meaningful name in the Symbol text box, e.g. "union" and then click the union symbol in the set of symbols.  
Click Add and then OK.  
Click OK to close the Symbols dialog, too.  
You are now finished and can enter the union symbol in the Commands window, by entering oper %union etc.  
Limits can be arranged in ways other than centered above/below the operator.  
Use the options provided by %PRODUCTNAME Math for working with superscript and subscript indexes.  
For example, enter sum_a^b c in the Commands window to arrange the limits to the right of the sum symbol.  
If your limit entries contain longer expressions, you must put them in group brackets, e.g. sum_{i=1}^{2*n} b.  
By the way, when formulas are imported from older versions this is done automatically.  
To change the spacing (gaps) between the characters choose Format - Spacing - Category - Indexes or Format - Spacing - Category - Limits.  
Additional basic information about indexes is given elsewhere in the Help.  
When you enter information manually in the Commands window, note that a number of operators require spaces for correct structure.  
This is especially true when your operators are supplied with values instead of placeholders, e.g. lim a_{n}=a.  
Functions  
Choose a function in the lower part of the window.  
These functions are also listed in the context menu of the Commands window.  
Any functions not contained in the Selection window need to be entered manually in the Commands window.

You can also directly enter left ldline<?> right rdlinein the Commands window.  
The size of the brackets is automatically adjusted.  
Angle brackets (scalable)  
Inserts scalable angle brackets with placeholders.  
You can also directly enter left langle<?> right ranglein the Commands window.  
The size of the brackets is automatically adjusted.  
Operator brackets (scalable)  
Inserts scalable operator brackets with placeholder.  
You can also enter left langle<?> mline <?> right ranglein the Commands window.  
The bracket size is adjusted automatically.  
Brace top (scalable)  
Use this symbol to insert a scalable horizontal upper brace with placeholders.  
You can also enter <?> overbrace <?>directly in the Commands window.  
The bracket size is adjusted automatically.  
Brace bottom (scalable)  
Use this symbol to insert a scalable horizontal lower brace with placeholders.  
You can also enter <?> underbrace <?>directly in the Commands window.  
The bracket size is adjusted automatically.  
Enter lfloor<?>rfloor directly in the Commands window to insert left and right lines with integer floor with a placeholder between them.  
Entry without the placeholder is also possible.  
Enter lceil<?>rceil directly in the Commands window to insert left and right lines with integer ceiling and a placeholder between them.  
Entry without the placeholder is also possible.  
Enter left lfloor<?>right rfloor directly in the Commands window to insert scalable left and right lines with integer floor with a placeholder between them.  
Entry is also possible without a placeholder.  
Enter left lceil<?> right rceildirectly in the Commands window to insert scalable left and right lines with integer ceilingwith a placeholder between them.  
Entry is also possible without a placeholder.  
Brackets are automatically sized when you put left and right in front of them, e.g. left(a over b right).  
To set the size and spacing, choose Format - Spacing - Category - Brackets.  
At Excess size (left/right), enter 5%, for example, then mark the Scale all brackets check box and enter 0% at Excess size there.  
The result you achieve by this is: left (left (left ((((a over b))) right) right) right).  
You can also use brackets without a group function, i.e. individually.  
To do this, set a backslash\ in front of the command.  
For example, when you enter \[, the left square bracket appears without its counterpart.  
You can thus reverse brackets using the backslash, e.g. \]\[ sets the brackets back to back.  
This is good for constructing intervals, for instance.  
Try the following example of an open interval: \]a;b\[=lbrace x \lline a<x<b rbrace. (Use copy and paste.) Only non-scalable brackets can be used individually.  
To change the size, you must use the size command, e.g. size 50 \[.  
This ensures that the correct structure is recognized.

You can also enter stack {<?>#<?>#<?>}in the Commands window.  
Small Gap  
This symbol inserts a small gap with one placeholder.  
You can also type ` directly in the Commands window.  
However, this only makes sense when it appears to the left or right of a symbol, variable, number or complete command.  
Align Left  
This symbol assigns left-alignment for "a" and inserts a placeholder.  
Instead of using the symbol, you can directly enter alignl<?> in the Commands window.  
Align to Horizontal Center  
This symbol inserts central alignment and a placeholder in the Commands window.  
Instead of using the symbol, you can directly type alignc<?> in the Commands window.  
Align Right  
This symbol inserts the command for right alignment and a placeholder.  
Instead of using the symbol, you can directly enter alignr<?> in the Commands window.  
Matrix Stack  
This icon inserts a matrix with four placeholders.  
You can also type matrix{<?>#<?>##<?>#<?>#} directly in the Commands window.  
The position of an element inside this diagram is indicated by two coordinates; the first specifies the line number and the second the column number.  
You can expand this matrix in any direction in the Commands window by adding other characters to it.  
Gap  
This symbol inserts a gap with one placeholder.  
You can also enter a tilde ~ directly in the Commands window.  
However, this only makes sense when it appears to the left or right of a symbol, variable, number or complete command.  
For alignment, the alignl, alignc and alignr commands are especially effective, if you are  
aligning numbers and denominators, e.g. {alignl a}over{b+c};  
constructing binoms or stacks, e.g. binom{2*n}{alignr k};  
aligning the elements in a matrix, e.g. matrix{alignr a#b+2##c+1/3#alignl d} and  
beginning a new line, e.g. a+b-c newline alignr x/y.  
When using the align instructions, please note that  
they should only be placed at the beginning of expressions and only occur once.  
Therefore you cannot enter a+alignr b, but can enter a+b alignr c;  
they mutually affect each other, which means that entering {alignl{alignr a}}over{b+c} aligns a on the right.  
If a line or an expression begins with text, as standard it is aligned on the left.  
With the corresponding align commands you can of course make a different format, compare stack{a+b-c*d#a-b+c#"text "} with stack{a+b-c*d#alignl a-b+c#alignr" text "}.  
Text must always be surrounded by inverted commas (not typographic).  
An interesting possibility for alignment is offered with using empty groups or character strings.  
Place an empty character string, i.e. the inverted commas which surround any text "", before the section of formula, which you want to align on the left.  
The standard centralized formulas can be aligned to the left, without using the Format - Alignment menu for this, compare "An example" newline a+b newline "" c-d.  
Similarly with empty groups, compare b+b+b+b+{}"This is another example "newline a+a+a+a+a+a.  
Here the text, presupposing that the standard settings were not changed, is centered.  
When typing information in the command window, note that some formats require spaces for the correct structure.  
This is especially true when entering values (e.g. a lsup{3}) instead of placeholders.

Syntax: size*1.5 {%rho (FONT SANS BOLD q, %omega) = int FONT SANS e^{i %omega t} %rho (FONT SANS BOLD q, t) d t}  
Brackets and Grouping  
The quotation marks in the examples serve only for emphasis in the text and do not belong to the content of the examples and commands.  
During manual entry of the samples in the command window, please note that spaces are often required for correct structure.  
Using this symbol you can group several other expressions/icons into one new expression.  
The example "{a + b}over{c + d} - e" illustrates this.  
The brackets in this example are not shown in the formula documents also do not need any space.  
Set brackets were previously inserted in the Selection window or directly in the Command window as "left lbrace<?> right rbrace".  
Now, a left and a right set bracket can also be inserted using "lbrace" and "rbrace", without or without wildcards.  
There are a total of eight (8) different types of brackets available!  
The "ceil" and "floor" brackets are often used for rounding up or down the argument to the next integer in Computer Science: "lceil -3.7 rceil = -3" or "lfloor -3.7 rfloor = -4".  
Pointed brackets with a vertical line in between them are common in Physics: "langle a mline b rangle" or "langle a mline b mline c over d mline e rangle." The height and positioning of the vertical lines always corresponds exactly to the enclosing brackets.  
All brackets may only occur in the correct pairing.  
The brackets have some common characteristics:  
All types of brackets show the same functions in groups as are described for "{}" - brackets.  
All types of brackets, including those visible, allow the definition of empty groups.  
The enclosed expression may therefore be empty.  
Another common characteristic of all these brackets is that they do not adjust their size to the enclosed expression, which is true in both directions.  
For example, if you want "(a over b)" with a bracket size adjusted to a and b you must insert "left" and "right".  
Entering "left(a over b right)" produces appropriate sizing.  
The same is true for the different entries and therefore the appropriate results of "(size 3{a over b})" and "left(size 3{a over b}right)".  
If the brackets themselves are part of the expression whose size is changed, they are also part of the size change: "size 3(a over b)" and "size 12(a over b)".  
Of course, the sizing bracket to bracketed expression ratio does not change in any way.  
Since "left" and "right" ensure unique mutual assignments of the brackets, every single bracket can be used as an argument for these two brackets, even the right brackets on the left side and vice versa.  
Instead of one bracket it may say "none" there, which means that there is no bracket shown there and that there is no room reserved for a bracket.  
Using this, you can create expressions like the following:  
left lbrace x right none  
left [x right)  
left] x right [  
left rangle x right lfloor  
The same rules apply to "left" and "right" as to the other brackets, specifically, they also work as group builders and may enclose the empty expression.  
The combination of brackets that do not belong together as well as brackets on one side only and repositioning left and right occur often.  
This is illustrated by an example from math; this, however, cannot be entered like this:  
[2, 3) - right open interval  
Using "left" and "right" you can set individual brackets; however, the brackets do not have any fixed size because they adjust to the argument.  
Therefore, there is now the possibility of displaying single brackets with a fixed size, by putting a "\" (backslash) in front of normal brackets.  
See "size *2 \langle x \rangle" and "size *2 langle x rangle"  
The complete overview looks as follows:  
\{ or \lbrace,\} or \rbrace  
\(,\)  
\[,\]  
\langle, \rangle  
\lceil, \rceil  
\lfloor, \rfloor  
\lline, \rline  
\ldline, \rdline  
In this way, intervals like the one above can be built in %PRODUCTNAME Math without any problems: \[2 "," 3\) or "\]2", "3\[ (Attention:  
These quotation marks are part of the entry.)  
Please note that the quotation marks must be entered and can be obtained with (Shift)(2) and not with typographical quotation marks.  
Generally, punctuation marks (like the comma in this case) should always be set as text; spaces often look good as well.  
Although it is also possible to use "\[2,~3\)" the above option is preferred.  
In the example above, "fixed size" always describes a bracket size dependent on the font size used.  
The cascading of groups is relatively problem-free.  
For hat "{a + b}" the "hat" is displayed simply over the center of "{a + b}".  
Also, "color red lceil a rceil" and "grave hat langle x * y rangle" work as expected.  
The result of the latter can be compared to "grave {hat langle x * y rangle}." This is not surprising since these attributes do not compete but rather can be combined.  
This differs slightly for competing or at least mutually influencing attributes.  
For example, which color does the b have in "color yellow color red (a + color green b)", or which size does it have in "size *4 (a + size /2 b)"?  
Given a base size of 12, does it have the size 48, 6 or even 24 (which could be seen as a combination)?  
The following description did basically apply to %PRODUCTNAME 4.0; however, this is now the basic resolution rule, which will be followed consistently in the future.  
In principle, this rule applies to all group operations.  
This only has a visible effect on the font attributes, like "bold", "ital", "phantom", "size", "color" and "font":  
Group operations in sequence will be treated as if every single operation was again enclosed by {}.  
They are grouped in cascades and on every cascade level there is no more than one operation: "size 12 color red font sans size -5 (a + size 8 b)" like "{size 12{color red{font sans{size -5 (a + {size 8 b})}}}}".  
This is then interpreted from left to right, where an operation only completed the changes for its corresponding group (or expression).  
There, the operations further to the right "replace" or "combine themselves with" their predecessors.  
See also "a + size *2 (b * size -8 c_1)^2"  
"color..." and "font..." as well as "size n" (n is a decimal) replace any preceding operations of the same type,  
for "size +n", "size -n", "size *n", and "size /n" the effects of the operations are combined,  
"size *2 size -5 a" would be double the starting size minus 5  
"font sans (a + font serif b)"  
"size *2 (a + size /2 b)"  
For the StarSymbol Unicode font there are 2 exceptions to these rules:  
It ignores "font" commands.  
Otherwise, there would often be different characters from the ones desired, e.g. "font sans (a oplus b)" would then neither have brackets nor an "oplus".  
The "ital" commands are ignored, e.g. "ital (a + b)".  
This happens because mathematical symbols are not common; even in combination with text in italics.  
These can easily be used in any context.  
This enables you to copy to other areas by using Copy and Paste, and the result still remains similar.  
Furthermore, such expressions "survive" a change of the base size in ht menu better than when using "size n".  
If you use only "size *" and "size /" (e.g. "size *1.24 a or size /0.86 a") the proportions should be kept intact.  
Examples (with a base size of 12 and 50% for indexes):  
Exactly identical proportions with "size 18 a_n" and "size *1.5 a_n".  
This differs in different contexts: "x^{size 18 a_n}" and "x^{size *1.5 a_n}"  
Examples with size +n for a comparison.  
They look identical:  
a_{size 8 n}  
a_{size +2 n}  
a_{size *1.333 n}  
The following examples, however, do not look identical:  
x^{a_{size 8 n}}  
x^{a_{size +2 n}}  
x^{a_{size *1.333 n}}  
Note that all n here have different sizes.  
The size 1.333 results from 8/6, the desired size divided by the default index size 6. (Index size 50% with a base size of 12)  
Indexes and Exponents  
Here, you will find basic information about indexes and exponents in %PRODUCTNAME Math.  
You can try out the examples described here and understand the details discussed. (The quotation marks in this text are for emphasis purposes only and are not part of the examples.)  
Index and exponent for a character are displayed on top of each other, specifically left-justified for the base character, e.g. a_2^3 "or" a^3_2.  
This can be in any order.  
Instead of '_' and '^', you can use 'sub' and 'sup' like before.  
On the contrary, it is no longer possible to work according to the following patterns:  
a_2_3  
a^2^3  
a_2^3_4  
Every sub-/superscript position at a base character can only be used once.  
You must use brackets to indicate the desired result.  
The following example illustrates this:  
a_{2_3}  
a^{2^3}  
a_2^{3_4}  
a_{2^3}^{4_5}  
Unlike other formula editors where "_" and "^" only refer to the next character (therefore for "a_24" only to 2), %PRODUCTNAME Math only refers to the entire number(s)/name(s)/text.  
If you want to put superscript and subscript in sequence, it can be written as follows: a_2{}^3 bzw. a^3{}_2  
To write tensors, %PRODUCTNAME Math provides several options.  
In addition to the notation "R_i{}^{jk}{}_l", common in other applications, additional notations can be used, namely "R_i{}^jk{}_l" and "{{R_i}^jk}_l."  
Super- and subscripts left of the base character can also be written, namely right-justified.  
To do this, the new commands "lsub" and "lsup" are used.  
See also "a lsub 2 lsup 3."  
The rules governing unambiguity and the necessity to use brackets remain the same.  
In principle, this can be achieved with {}_2^3 a.  
The commands "sub" and "sup" are also available as "rsub" and "rsup".  
Using this, you can ideally attach mass, proton, and charge numbers to chemical elements: "font sans Zn lsub 30 lsup 63 rsup {2+{}}."  
Using the "csub" and "csup" commands, you can write super- and subscripts directly above or below a character.  
See also "a csub y csup x." All types of indexes and exponents together are also possible: "abc_1^2 lsub 3 lsup 4 csub 55555 csup 66666."  
Super- and subscripts can be attached to most unary and binary operators.  
Two examples: "a div_2 b a<csub n b +_2 h" and "a toward csub f b x toward csup f y."  
Note that during manual entry of these examples into the Command window the existing spaces are required for correct structure.  
Attributes  
Additional information about attributes in %PRODUCTNAME Math can be found on this page. (The quotation marks are for emphasis purposes only and are not part of the examples or commands.)  
The acute, bar, breve, check, circle, dot, ddot, dddot, grave, hat, tilde and vec attributes do not always have a fixed size and do not become wider (longer) if they are above a long symbol (see also e.g. dot v and dot vvvvvvv_22222 in old and new form).  
By default, they are centered (vgl dot v_maximum with {dot v}_maximum)  
The only attributes which grow with the length of the symbol are "overline", "underline" and "overstrike." (Also, "overstrike" puts a horizontal line through the "a" and not above it.)  
The differences between "bar" and "overline" are important.  
While "bar a" and "overline a" look relatively similar (except that "bar" shows a slightly shorter line), this looks totally different for long symbols.  
These differences become evident if you compare "bar aaaaa" to "overline aaaaa".  
While "bar" shows the line above one character only, "overline" adjusts to the length of the character string and shows a line above all five a in the example given.  
For some character strings, it can happen that a line inserted with "underline" is too close to the character.  
In these cases, an empty group helps, as shown in the following example.  
The common font Times New Roman was selected; as letter a capital Q: "underline Q sub {}" instead of "underline Q."  
Scaling  
More detailed information about scaling in %PRODUCTNAME Math as well as some examples can be found here. (The quotation marks in this text are for emphasis purposes only and are not part of the examples.)  
The factorial character is not scaled, see also "fact stack{a#b}" and "fact {a over b}", but is oriented using the baseline or center of the arguments.  
Brackets always have a fixed size as well.  
See also "(((a)))", "(stack{a#b#c})", "(a over b)."  
See also "left(left(left(a right)right)right)", "left(stack{a#b#c}right)", "left(a over b right)."  
Some Attributes have fixed sizes; do not change these if they are placed above a long symbol.  
You may not delete them when making entries in the Commands window.

Fonts  
Define the fonts to be applied to certain formula elements here.  
Formula fonts  
In this area, specify the fonts for the formula elements you install with %PRODUCTNAME, i.e. the variables, functions and numbers.  
A font is also selected here for the texts you have inserted.  
At the beginning, you only see the fonts given by the program for each area in the list boxes.  
Behind the functions entry there is only the Times New Roman font available.  
If you want the function display to occasionally or always show a different font, then you can expand the list box with other fonts, so that you can then later choose among them.  
Use the Change button to expand the selection offered in the list box.  
If you want to mark individual text segments with a font other than that used for the whole text, then choose the FONT command in the command window.  
Variables  
Select the fonts for the variables in your formula.  
For example, in the x=SIN(y) formula, x and y will be the variables.  
Functions  
Select the fonts for the names and other function elements.  
For example, the variables for the x=SIN(y) formula will be =SIN().  
Numbers  
Select the fonts for the numbers in your formula here.  
Text  
Define the fonts for the rest of the text in your formula here.  
Custom fonts  
In this area define three fonts with which you can format other text segments in the formula.  
The three basic fonts Serif, Sans and Fixed are available.  
You can add any other font to each standard installed basic font.  
Every font installed on your system is available for you to use.  
Select the Change button to expand the selection offered in the list box.  
These custom fonts are used if you set a different font with the FONT command in the command window.  
As an illustration, copy the following text into the command window:  
font sans "We present:" newline  
font serif "%PRODUCTNAME Math," newline  
font serif "the formula editor by" newline  
font sans "%PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION" newline  
font serif "from" newline  
font fixed "Sun Microsystems"  
Serif  
Specify the font to be used for the font serif format.  
Serifs are the small "guides" that can be seen for example, at the bottom of a capital A when the Times serif font is used.  
Using serifs is quite helpful since it guides a reader's eye in a straight line and can speed up reading.  
Sans  
Specify the font to be used in the formula for the sans font formatting.  
Sans serif fonts such as Arial are commonly used for titles.  
Fixed  
Specify the font to be used for the font fixed formatting.  
Non-proportional fonts such as Courier can be used for tables.

Spacing  
Use this dialog to determine the spacing between formula elements, for example, indexes, limits, operators, etc.  
The spacing is specified in percent, in relation to the base size defined under Format - Font Size.  
The percentile values allowed range from 0% to over 100%.  
Use the Category button to determine the formula element for which you would like to specify the spacing.  
The appearance of the dialog will depend on the selected category.  
A preview window shows you which spacing is modified via the respective boxes.  
The following categories are available and will be described below:  
Spacing, Indices, Fractions, Fraction Bars, Limits, Brackets, Matrices, Symbols, Operators and Borders.  
Category  
Click here to modify the element spacing for a certain category.  
Spacing  
Define the spacing between variables and operators, lines and root signs and radicals.  
Spacing  
Defines the spacing between variables and operators.  
Line Spacing  
Determine the spacing between the lines here.  
Root Spacing  
Determine the spacing between the root sign and radicals here.  
Indices  
Define the spacing for superscript and subscript indices.  
Superscript  
Determine the spacing for superscript indices here.  
Subscript  
Determine the spacing for subscript indices here.  
Fractions  
Define the spacing between the fraction bar and the numerator or denominator.  
Numerator  
Determine the spacing between the fraction bar and the numerator here.  
Denominator  
Determine the spacing between the fraction bar and the denominator here.  
Fraction bar  
Define the excess length and line weight of the fraction bar.  
Excess length  
Determine the excess length of the fraction line here.  
Line weight  
Determine the line weight of the fraction line here.  
Limits  
Define the spacing between the sum symbol and the limit conditions.  
Upper limit  
Determine the spacing between the sum symbol and the upper limit here.  
Lower limit  
Determine the spacing between the sum symbol and the initial condition here.  
Brackets  
Define the spacing between brackets and the content.  
Excess size (left/right)  
Determine the vertical distance between the upper edge of the contents and the upper end of the brackets.  
Spacing  
Determine the horizontal distance between the contents and the upper end of the brackets.  
Scale all brackets  
Select this field and all types of brackets will be scaled.  
If you then enter (a over b) in the command window, the brackets will surround the whole height of the argument.  
You normally achieve such an effect by entering left (a over b right).  
Excess size  
Adjust the percentage excess size with this spin button, which should have the brackets opposite its content.  
At 0 percent the brackets are set so that they surround the argument at the same height.  
The higher the entered value is, the larger the vertical gap between the contents of the brackets and the external border of the brackets.  
The field can only be used in combination with Scale all brackets.  
You can form increasingly complex brackets very simply with a combination of settings.  
For example, enter left/right excess size 5 percent.  
Select the Scale all brackets field and set the accompanying Outsize spin button to 0 percent.  
You see the result, if you enter nestings as follows: left (left (left ((((a over b))) right) right) right)  
Matrix  
Define the relative spacing for the elements in a matrix.  
Line spacing  
Determine the spacing between matrix elements in a row here.  
Column spacing  
Determine the spacing between matrix elements in a column here.  
Symbols  
Define the spacing of symbols in relation to variables  
Primary height  
Define the height of the symbols in relation to the baseline here.  
Minimum distance  
Determine the minimum distance between a symbol and variable here.  
If you want to produce several horizontal dashes above a character, e.g. overline {overline A intersection overline B}, and the gap between the dashes is too small, you can enlarge it with the minimum gap spin button.  
Simply enter a higher percentage.  
Operators  
Define the spacing between operators and variables or numbers.  
Excess height  
Determine the height from the variable to the operator's upper edge.  
Spacing  
Determine the horizontal distance between operators and variables here.  
Borders  
You can give your formula borders with settings here.  
This option is particularly interesting if you want to integrate the formula into %PRODUCTNAME Writer and into the text.  
When making settings, make sure that you do not use 0 as a size, as this creates viewing problems for the surrounded text in the mentioned positions.  
Left  
Here the left border is positioned between the formula and background.  
Right  
Here the right border is positioned between the formula and background.  
Top  
Here the top border is positioned between the formula and background.  
Bottom  
Here the bottom border is positioned between the formula and background.  
Default  
Click here to save your changes as your default settings for all new formulas.  
A security response will appear before saving these changes.  
The function of this "Default" button is different from the other default buttons in %PRODUCTNAME!  
Alignment  
This is where you define the alignment for formulas with more than one line and formulas with several elements in one line.  
You can create multiple-line formulas by entering the the New Line command when formatting a formula.  
Numerators and denominators are also constitute multiple-line formulas.  
An equal sign in a formula divides the formula in two parts: a left and a right part (unless within an expression in brackets).  
Horizontal  
This area is used for the horizontal aligning of multiline formulas.  
Left  
Aligns both lines of a formula to the left.  
To quickly align a particular formula line to the left, i.e. assign it to a text, simply set two inverted commas "" at the beginning.  
The empty character string produced "convinces" %PRODUCTNAME Math that it is a text line.  
As text is always aligned left, the formula line also lines up there.  
All other formulas are centered.  
To center a text however, begin with an empty group {}.  
Fine adjustments can be made under Format - Gaps.  
Centered  
Aligns both lines of a formula to the center.  
Right  
Aligns both lines of a formula to the right.  
Default  
Click here to save your changes as the default settings for new formulas.  
A security response will appear before saving.  
Text Mode  
This command switches the text mode on or off.  
In the text mode, formulas are displayed in the same height as a line of text.  
Catalog  
This command opens the Symbols dialog in which you select a symbol to insert in the formula.

Import formula  
This command opens a dialog for importing a formula.  
The Insert dialog is set up like the Open dialog under File.  
Use the Insert dialog to load, edit and display (if necessary, choose View - Refresh) a formula saved as a file in the Commands window.  
Formula Cursor  
Use this icon to turn the formula cursor on or off.  
The part of the formula where the cursor is positioned in the Commands window is marked with a thin border when the formula cursor is active.  
You can also click a certain position in the document to move the cursor to the respective position in the Commands window.  
Double-clicking a character in the document moves the cursor in the Commands window and highlights the position.  
Here are some examples to show how this function works:  
Sin (x)  
All components are marked by the formula cursor.  
Size *2 bold italic w  
Only the W is marked since the other characters are not displayed in the text window.  
Sum from a to b x_i^2  
The from and to components are characters, which are not displayed and thus not selected.  
"This is text."  
The entire text in parentheses is selected.  
Formula Shortcut Keys  
A list of the shortcut keys specific to creating formulas is contained in this section.  
Moreover, the general shortcut keys in %PRODUCTNAME also apply.  
The commands, activated by the shortcuts shown here, can also be found using the menus Edit and View.

Manually Aligning Formula Parts  
How do you align characters in %PRODUCTNAME Math quickly and easily?  
To accomplish this, you must define empty groups and character strings.  
They do not require any space, but carry information that helps in the alignment process.  
To create empty groups, enter curly brackets {} in the command window.  
In the following example, the goal is to achieve a line break so that the plus signs are beneath one another, even though one less character is entered in the upper line: a+a+a+{} newline {}{}{}{}{}a+a+a+a  
They are defined using double inverted commas "".  
Make sure you do not use any typographic inverted commas.  
Example: "A further example." newline a+b newline "" c-d  
Changing Default Attributes  
Can default formats in %PRODUCTNAME Math be modified?  
If parts of formulas are formatted bold or italic by default, you can change these attributes with the commands "nbold" and "nitalic".  
For example: nitalic a + bold b returns an A no longer in italics and a B in bold.  
Note: the plus sign cannot be modified this way.  
Merging Formula Parts in Brackets  
Inserting fractions into formulas  
In the case of a fraction whose numerator and denominator consist of a product, a sum, etc., the values that belong together must be bracketed together.  
Use the following syntax: "{a + c} over 2 = m" or "m = {a + c} over 2"  
Entering Comments  
How does one attach comments that don't appear in the document to a formula?  
A comment should begin with a double percent sign%%, and will extend to the next line-end character (Enter key).  
Everything that lies in between is ignored and is not printed out.  
If there are percent signs in the text, they are treated as part of the text.  
Example: a^2+b^2=c^2%% Pythagorean theorem.  
Instructions for Using %PRODUCTNAME Math  
Entering and Editing Formulas  
Entering Line Breaks  
How to write formulas in %PRODUCTNAME Math over two lines (with manual line break):  
Create a line break by using the "newline" command.  
Everything coming after the line break is placed on the next line.  
Inserting Brackets  
In %PRODUCTNAME Math, can brackets be shown separately so that the distance between them is freely definable?  
You can set individual brackets using "left" and "right", but the distance between the brackets will not be fixed, as they adapt to the argument.  
Nevertheless, there is a way to display brackets so that the distance between them is fixed.  
To accomplish this, place a "\" (backslash) before the normal brackets.  
Consider "left lbrace x right none" and "size *2 langle x rangle" and "size *2 \langle x \rangle".  
If you want to try the examples, enter them without inverted commas.

Toolbars  
The default toolbars available when working with an activated formula document in %PRODUCTNAME Math are described here.  
Customize the toolbars to meet your requirements by moving, deleting or adding new icons.  
However, as soon as you modify the toolbars, the configuration no longer corresponds to the description here.  
Status Bar  
The status bar displays information about the active document and can be configured under Tools - Customize.  
The default setting contains the following fields:  
Main Toolbar  
The main toolbar contains the most important and frequently used functions.  
Formula Cursor  
Functionality of %PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION Math  
An overview of some of the important functions and capabilities that %PRODUCTNAME Math offers can be found in this section.  
These are all clearly ordered in a selection window and you only need to click on the required element with the mouse to insert the object into your work.  
Furthermore there is an exhaustive reference list and numerous samples contained in the Help.  
Creating a Formula  
You create formulas in much the same way you do charts or images; usually as objects within a document. %PRODUCTNAME Math is automatically started when you want to insert a formula into another document.  
Create, edit and format the formula using a large selection of pre-defined symbols and functions.  
Entering a Formula Directly  
Once you have become more familiar with the %PRODUCTNAME Math language, you can also enter a formula directly.  
After you select this text and choose the appropriate command, the text will be converted into a formatted formula.  
By the way, formulas cannot be calculated here because this is only a formula editor (for writing and showing formulas), not a calculation program.  
Use spreadsheets to calculate formulas, or for simple calculations use the text document calculation function.  
Creating a Formula in the Commands Window  
Use the %PRODUCTNAME Math Commands window to describe and edit the description of a formula.  
As you make entries in the Commands window you see them in the text.  
To maintain an overview when creating long and complicated formulas, use the formula cursor on the main toolbar.  
It shows you in the text window, where in the Commands window you are in the formula and vice versa.  
If you click a specific location in either one of the windows, you will see it in the other one.  
Individual Symbols  
You can create your own symbols and adopt characters from other fonts.  
You can add any number of new symbols to the basic catalog of %PRODUCTNAME Math symbols, or create your own special catalogs.  
Numerous special characters are also available.  
Formulas in Context  
To make working with formulas easier use the context menus which can be called up with a right mouse click.  
This applies especially to the Command window.  
Not only does this context menu contain all the commands that are found in the Selection window but also many more possibilities.  
The context menu also contains operators, etc. which can be inserted into your formula by mouse click without having to key them into the Command window.

Navigator  
Use this function to turn the Navigator on or off.  
The Navigator can be used to jump to specific chapters and objects within a document and is useful for modifying the order of outline levels and inserting objects from other open documents.  
The context menu of the entries in the Navigator contains specific commands for these entries, for example, for editing or renaming, canceling table protection, converting the table of contents into a normal text, etc.  
The Navigator is a dockable window.  
It is also possible to click the icon on the Function bar or press the F5 key.  
If the Navigator covers an important area of your text, place the cursor on the title bar and drag the window into another position.  
To dock the Navigator's window, press the Command key (Ctrl) key while dragging.  
On the other hand, to undock the Navigator's window, press the Command key (Ctrl) key while double clicking on a free area of the Navigator's window.  
The Navigator lists various elements that may be available in your document.  
A small plus sign before an entry in the Navigator indicates an installed type.  
If you move the mouse over an entry, the Help Tips (Menu - Help - Tip) show how many elements of this type are contained in the document.  
If you click the plus sign in front of an entry, a list of elements in the document appears.  
Double-clicking one of the entries moves the cursor to the corresponding position in the document.  
If the contents of a document are located in hidden sections, these contents will be displayed in a gray color in the Navigator.  
The Help Tips then show the text in a "hidden" way.  
The same applies for contents, which are located in the headers or footers of Page Styles that are not used.  
Hidden contents can be found in the Navigator under tables, text frames, graphics, OLE objects, sections and indexes if they exist.  
To make changes to a specific element in your document, simply open the context menu in the Navigator and choose Edit....  
This command is available for tables, graphics, bookmarks, etc. and opens the appropriate dialog to edit the element.  
You can also remove cell protection in tables.  
If one or more table cells are protected with the Format - Cell - Protect option, you can remove the protection by choosing Tables - Remove protection on the context menu of the table entry.  
The command Remove Index contained in the context menu of an index converts a table of contents to text, for example.  
Use the Read-only command to switch the write protection for an index, for example, on and off.  
You can delete a selected object from your document by choosing Delete from the context menu of the object.  
You can also use the Delete key.  
The Rename command in the selected object's context menu in the Navigator displays a dialog where you are able to rename an object.  
Another way to jump quickly to certain contents in your document is via the Navigation floating toolbar at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar, activated by clicking the Navigation icon in the Navigator.

The Nonprinting Characters On/Off icon is on the main toolbar.  
Fields  
Use this command to switch between the display of field names or contents.  
Put a check mark at this item to see the names of the inserted fields in the document; no check mark means that the field contents are shown.  
The names are always visible, but the contents are not shown in some cases.  
More information about field commands can be found under Insert - Field commands.  
This function can also be enabled and disabled using the "Display - Field codes" check box under Tools - Options - Text Document - View.  
A dialog appears when you print a document while the display of fields as field codes is enabled.  
This dialog allows you to choose whether the document is to be printed with field codes (yes) or without field codes, i.e. with the values or contents of the fields (no) or whether the action should be canceled.  
Nonprinting Characters  
Click here to view or hide the nonprinting characters in your text, such as line breaks, tab stops and spaces.  
Nonprinting characters indicate the end of paragraphs, tabs and spaces.  
The ends of paragraphs have a visible paragraph mark, tabs are shown by a small right arrow and a space is depicted by a point.  
If a menu item is checked, the nonprinting characters in the document are visible in the Wrap Region.  
This is helpful if you want to copy sections that end or begin with such characters, and insert them in another position.  
The paragraph marks are particularly important if they contain the formatting information about the next paragraph.  
If you delete a paragraph mark, the next paragraph takes on the formatting of the previous paragraph.  
If you delete a paragraph mark directly before a table, you will also delete the table.  
To establish which of the nonprinting characters that are listed here should be displayed, choose Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids.  
The view of the nonprinting characters on the screen does not have an effect on the printout.  
Online Layout  
Select Online Layout to display the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document as if it were an HTML document.  
This function is especially useful when creating Internet documents.  
In the online layout, the document is displayed with html.stw.  
In this view, you see a very long page so that when you view Internet pages a disrupting page break seldom occurs.  
Only one view of the document is possible; if you have opened more than one view of the document (Menu Window - New Window), then the other windows will be closed when you activate Online Layouts.

Use this command to view the document layout as it will appear when printed.  
The View - Print Layout command is only visible if a HTML documents is open.  
Hidden Paragraphs  
Select this command to hide and show hidden paragraphs.  
You can also activate this function using the Hidden paragraphs check box under Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids.  
Hidden paragraphs are paragraphs whose view is made dependent on a condition with the field command "Hidden Paragraph".  
If the condition is met, the paragraph is hidden and will not be printed.  
If the condition is not met, the paragraph is not hidden and will be printed.  
It does not matter whether the option for displaying hidden paragraphs is active or not because this option only affects the screen display.  
When paragraphs are hidden, their footnotes and character frames are hidden as well.  
Insert Manual Break  
Use this function to insert a manual line break, column break or page break at the current cursor position.  
Type  
Select the type of break to be inserted.

You can also use the Shift+ Enter key combination to insert a line break.  
Column Break  
Text to the right of the cursor (in multi-column text) is shifted to the beginning of the next column.  
The inserted column break is indicated by a blue border at the top of the new column.  
Page Break  
Text to the right of the cursor is shifted to the beginning of the next page.  
The inserted page break is indicated by a blue border at the top of the new page.  
You can also insert a page break with Command Ctrl +Enter.  
However, if you want to assign the following page a different Page Style, you must use the menu command to insert the manual page break instead of the key combination.  
Style  
Choose a new Style for the page inserted after a page break.  
Change page number  
Click here to change the automatic numbering for the new page after the page break.

Insert Section  
Use this command to insert at the cursor position a section that can be dealt with separately from the normal text.  
This allows you to hide text passages, work with several column distributions per page or define paragraphs as read-only.  
It is also possible to link the display of a section to certain conditions.  
Additionally, you can create a link for a section to another file or a named section in the other file, or via DDE.  
To edit an inserted section, select the menu command Format - Sections.  
%PRODUCTNAME creates a section based on the current selected text areas.  
If no text is selected, the section consists only of an empty paragraph.  
The following tab appears:  
Insert  
Click this button to insert your settings at the current cursor position in the document.  
Section  
This is where you enter a name for the section and set its options.  
New Section  
Enter a name for the new section here. %PRODUCTNAME uses the default name Section X, where X represents a continuous number, starting with Section1.  
Link  
Link  
Click here to link the section in your document to a section in another file.  
DDE  
If the check box Link is marked, you can also create a link via DDE.  
To do this, mark the DDE check box and enter the desired DDE command.  
The general syntax for a DDE command is as follows: "<Server> <Topic> <Item> ".  
Server is the indication for the DDE name of the application where the data is stored.  
Topic refers to the location of the Item (usually the file name), and Item represents the actual object.  
Here are two examples:  
To insert a section named "Section1" from a %PRODUCTNAME text document abc.sxw via DDE, use the command: "soffice x:\abc.sxw Section1".  
To insert the contents of the first cell from a MS Excel spreadsheet file named "abc.xls", use the DDE command: "excel x:\[abc.xls]Sheet1 z1s1".  
If you copy the elements and insert the clipboard contents as a DDE link with Edit - Paste Contents, you can view the corresponding syntax by selecting the Edit - Fields command.  
File name / DDE command  
Enter the path and name of the file in this field or, when DDE is marked, enter the DDE command.  
...  
Use this button to find a file.  
It is only activated if the Link check box is marked.  
Section  
Choose a section from the selected file to be linked.

When you reload the document, you will be asked whether or not the link should be updated.  
Write Protection  
Protected  
To prevent the section from being modified or edited, mark this check box.  
This ensures that elements are not unintentionally edited or moved.  
With password  
If you define a password, you can also protect the section from modifications by a third party.  
...  
Click here to see the dialog for entering the password.  
Hide  
Hide  
Mark this check box to hide the selected section in your document.  
This keeps certain sections in the document from being displayed or printed.  
The contents of the hidden sections are displayed in gray in the Navigator.  
In addition, the Help tips display the text as "hidden".  
Choose Format - Sections to disable this function.  
With condition  
Click in the text box to enter a condition for the display of the section, if you only want the section to be shown or printed under certain conditions.  
A condition can only be modified if the Hide check box is selected.  
Condition  
Enter the condition under which the section is to be hidden.  
If the condition is TRUE, the section will be hidden.  
Conditions are logical expressions, such as "SALUTATION EQ Mr.".  
Using the mail merge form letter function, for example, if you have defined a database field "Salutation", containing either "Mr.", "Ms." or "Sir or Madam", you can specify that a section only be printed if the salutation is "Mr.".  
As another example, you can define the field variable "x" and set the value to 1.  
Then specify the condition for hiding the field: "x eq 1".  
The defined section will only be displayed if the field variable "x" is assigned a different value.  
For more information about Field commands and the syntax for conditions, see the corresponding section in the Help.

Click here to insert the selected field at the cursor position in your document.  
The dialog remains open.  
To insert another field, set the cursor at the desired position in the document and select the next field command in the dialog.  
Document  
Document fields are used to enter information pertaining to the current document, e.g. file name, template, statistics, user data, date, and time.  
For the HTML import and export of date and time fields, special %PRODUCTNAME formats are used.  
Field type  
Select the field type you want to insert into your document.  
The following fields are available:  
Field type  
Meaning  
Sender  
Inserting fields with user details.  
The field content is entered at the time of installation, and can be modified subsequently by choosing Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - User Data.  
User  
Inserting the user name or initials.  
To modify the details, choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - User Data.  
File name  
Inserting the filename and/or the directory path of the current document as well as the filename without extension.  
Date  
Entering the current date.  
This either can no longer be changed (Date fix) or it is updated automatically (Date var.).  
Under Format, you can choose the desired date format.  
Template  
Inserting the file name and/or the directory path of the current template as well as the filename without an extension.  
Apart from the physical file name, the formats "section" and "template" can also be used here and which use the names that are shown in the %PRODUCTNAME dialog Templates for organizing templates.  
Chapter  
Inserting the chapter number and/or the chapter name.  
Page  
Inserting the page number of the current, previous, or next page.  
Statistic  
Inserting statistics on the pages, paragraphs, words, characters, tables, images, and objects contained in the document.  
Time  
Inserting the current system time.  
It can either not be changed at all (time fixed) or it is updated when you update the field with (F9) (time var.).  
The following text fields are only visible or can be enabled if the corresponding field type was chosen.  
Selection  
This is where you select a field.  
Click this link for an introduction to Page Styles and page numbers.  
You have the following options for Page fields:  
Fields  
Function  
Previous page  
Inserting the page number of the previous page.  
Next page  
Inserting the page number of the next page.  
Page Number  
Inserts the current page number.  
Choose the desired numbering for the page number under Format.  
Now click on Text under Format and enter your own text in the Value text box.  
You can enter a correction factor under Correction, for example +1 or -1, by which the current page number in the display is changed.  
You need this function when the page number of the next page is to appear at the bottom of each page (Correction value +1).  
The page number calculated must exist in the document so that field contents can be inserted.  
The last page of the document, therefore, automatically does not show a next page number.  
Only integers can be displayed for page numbers, not a null value.  
Since the page calculated in this manner must also exist in the document, the -1 correction value only produces a correct display for the Previous Page function, for example, from Page 3.  
If you do not want to change the displayed page number so that the text "page 3" is shown at the bottom of page 2, for example, but rather change the number of the current page itself (page 2 actually becomes page 3), then you should use the command Insert - Manual Break... to insert a change to a new Page Style.  
If your double-click an entry while holding down the (Command) (Ctrl) key, it is immediately inserted into your document.  
Format  
This is where you select the format of the field to be inserted.  
You can determine your own format in addition to the given formats for date and time fields by clicking "Additional formats..." This option opens the dialog Number Format.  
If you choose the option "Chapter number without separator" for a chapter field, the separators determined under Tools - Chapter numbering... are left out.  
For reference fields, you can choose the chapter number as the format.  
Only the chapter number of the referenced object is shown in the reference.  
If this chapter level is not numbered, %PRODUCTNAME searches the parent levels for a numbered level and inserts the respective chapter number.  
If numbering or a list is inserted within a paragraph on a page, i.e., directly following a text, it is assigned to the paragraph.  
You can choose the format in which references to number ranges are made.  
The options include the following:  
Category and number  
The format contains everything between the beginning of the paragraph and what is directly after the number-range field  
Caption text  
The format contains the text following the number-range field up to the end of the paragraph  
Number  
The format contains only the reference number  
Level  
Select the desired level for a chapter field.  
Correction  
For fields specifying page numbers, you can enter a page number correction value here.  
Offset in days/minutes  
Here, you can enter the desired correction for a field with a date or a time.  
Value  
Enter the contents of user-defined fields here.  
References  
This is where you insert the references or referenced fields into the active document.  
References are referenced fields within the same document or within sub-documents of a master document.  
The advantage of entering a cross-reference as a field is that you do not have to adjust the references manually every time you change the document.  
Just update the fields with F9 and the references in the document are updated too.  
Field type  
Meaning  
Set Reference  
Set target for a referenced field.  
Under Name, enter a description for the reference.  
When inserting the reference, it will then appear as an identification in the list box Selection.  
In an HTML document, reference fields entered this way will be ignored.For the target in HTML documents, you have to insert a reference field.  
Insert reference  
Inserting a referenced field to another position in the document.  
Otherwise, inserting a reference by choosing a field name under Selection is not possible.  
In master documents, you can also reference from one sub-document to another.  
Note that the reference name will not appear in the selection field and has to be entered "by hand".  
In an HTML document, reference fields entered this way will be ignored.  
For referenced fields in HTML documents, you have to insert a hyperlink.  
References are fields.  
To remove a reference, delete the field.  
You can then reinsert it as "unformatted text" at the same position using the command Edit - Insert Contents.  
The text remains intact while the reference is deleted.  
After inserting a bookmark in the document with Insert - Bookmark, the bookmarks entry on the References tab becomes visible.  
Bookmarks are used to mark certain text passages in a document.  
In a text document, you can use the bookmarks, for example, to jump from one passage in the document to another.  
In an HTML document, these bookmarks become anchors (A name), which determine the target of hyperlinks for example.  
Name  
Enter the name of user-defined fields here.  
Set a target to give the field a name.  
If you then insert a reference to it, use the name that appears at the field type "Set reference" in the selection field to identify the target.  
For references within the sub-documents of a master document, the name of a reference that is not in the same sub-document has to be entered manually.  
When you set a reference to a selection in the text, the current selection is used as field contents.  
Functions  
This is where you enter the values for additional function parameters.  
The type of parameter depends on the function selected.  
Function fields execute a certain function which can be tied to a condition, depending on the field type.  
You can define fields that execute a certain macro when clicked with the mouse or fields that hide a text passage depending on a certain condition.  
For graphics, tables, frames and other objects, you can define placeholders in order to insert the objects into the document when needed.  
Field type  
Meaning  
Conditional text  
Insert text depending on a condition.  
Under Condition enter "x eq 1" for example (without the quotes).  
Under Then, enter a text that is inserted in the case x=1; under Else enter a text that is inserted otherwise.  
Variables).  
Input field  
Inserting form fields for text input.  
You can add a remark.  
When you click the Insert button, the dialog Input Field appears, where you can enter and edit the desired text.  
Execute macro  
Insert a text field that automatically executes an assigned macro following a double-click.  
You can choose the desired macro with the Macro... button.  
After choosing the macro, you can enter the necessary remarks in the text field Remark.  
Placeholder  
Insert a placeholder in the document.  
You determine the placeholder type under Format.  
Possible explanations can be entered under Remarks.  
If you click the placeholder in the document, you can insert the object that is represented by the placeholder.  
Hidden text  
Insert a text that is hidden if a condition is met.  
In order to hide such text on screen, deactivate the check box Hidden text under Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids.  
Hidden paragraph  
Hide a paragraph if the condition entered under Condition is true.  
This field can be used, for example, to suppress empty paragraphs during printing.  
To hide such paragraphs on screen, deactivate the menu command View - Hidden Paragraphs or the check box Hidden Paragraphs under Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids.  
The conditions for "Hidden Text" and "Hidden Paragraph" can now be formulated in a similar manner.  
In earlier document formats, up until StarWriter 4.0, the reversed logic was valid for "Hidden text".  
When saving and loading older formats, the logic for "hidden text" is therefore automatically reversed.  
Combine characters (only when Asian fonts are supported)  
Here, you can combine 1 to 6 characters that are treated as one normal character after they have been sucessfully combined.  
For function fields, the format field is only used for fields of the type placeholder.  
Here, the format determines the object for which the placeholder stands.  
Condition  
For fields linked to a condition, enter the criteria here.  
Then, Else  
Enter the field contents to be inserted depending on the corresponding condition.  
The contents will be assigned if the condition is met (Then) or not met (Else).  
These fields are only avaialbe for Conditional Text fields.  
Besides the regular text input, you can also enter database fields on the form "database name.table name.field name" (without the quotes) into the result fields Then and Else to insert the field content dependent on the condition.  
For such expressions, %PRODUCTNAME first tries to identify the text as a database column.  
If it exists, the content of the column is output; otherwise the text will be output.  
If a conditional text contains an expression of the form "database name.database table.field name" (without quotes), it is interpreted as a database expression and the corresponding content of the database field is inserted.  
If the quotes are used, the expression is interpreted as text and inserted.  
The quotes are automatically removed before the field content is displayed.  
If the table or field name does not exist in a database, nothing is inserted if no quotes are used.  
If the database name entered does not correspond to any database connected to %PRODUCTNAME, the expression is interpreted and inserted as text.  
Reference  
Enter the reference for the respective field type here.  
Selection  
Here you choose the respective macro of a module that is to be executed.  
If the selected module contains only one macro, the selection field only offers one entry in its selection.  
Macro name  
For fields that are used to execute a macro, the name of the macro selected in the selection field is displayed.  
Placeholder  
If you chose the field type Placeholder, you can define a placeholder here.  
Insert text  
For the field type hidden text, you can enter the text whose display depends on a condition.  
Character  
After you select the field type Combine characters, this is where you enter the characters to be combined.  
Value  
After you select Combine characters, this is where you enter a value.  
Macro...  
Click this button to open the Macro dialog to select a macro which will be executed by a mouse click on the field.  
This button is only active if you select the "Execute macro" function field.  
DocInformation  
DocInformation fields register information from the document properties.  
Apart from general information which %PRODUCTNAME generates and organizes automatically for each document, e.g., information on the creation and modification of the document, these fields also contain manually entered information for each document.  
The DocInformation is stored in %PRODUCTNAME under File - Properties.  
For the HTML import and export of DocInformation fields, special %PRODUCTNAME formats are used.  
Field type  
Meaning  
Modification  
Inserts the name of the author, date and/or time of the last save.  
Editing time  
Inserts the amount of time already spent for editing the document.  
Description  
Inserts the document description if it was entered in the document properties.  
Document number  
Inserts the current document number.  
Created  
Inserts the name of the author, date and/or time of the document creation.  
Info 0 - 3  
Inserts the contents of the info fields in the document properties.  
With File - Properties... - User, you can edit the content of the info fields.  
Most Recent Print  
Inserts the date and/or time and/or name of author for the most recent print.  
Keywords  
Inserts the keywords entered in File - Properties... - Description.  
Subject  
Inserts the subject entered in the document properties.  
Title  
Inserts the title entered in the document properties.  
In the DocInformation fields, you can choose among the fields Author, Time, and Date if you want to insert fields of the type Modified, Created, and Most Recent Print.  
Here+ you can enter the date and time format for the respective field type.  
Fixed content  
If this check box is marked, the field will be assigned a value when it is inserted into the document and not subsequently modified.  
Fields whose content is fixed are evaluated every time a new document is generated from a template or a text block with a FixField is inserted.  
As for the date fields, the data that was valid when the document was created from the template or when the text block was inserted is used here.  
This ensures that the global templates and text blocks can be used individually.  
Text blocks with such fields can be used for signatures for example.  
Variables  
With variable fields, you can control the content of your document dynamically.  
You can define variables individually or select them from preset variable types.  
User-defined fields are only available in the active document.  
Field Type  
Description  
Set Variable  
Definition of a variable and input of the value of variables.  
A variable can therefore take different values in different places of the document.  
Show Variable  
Inserting the current value of a variable.  
If you have defined a variable with the field type "Set variable" or changed its value with the field type Input field, you can insert the current value of the variable into the document with a field of the type "Display variables".  
The current value of variables in the document is determined by the previous field of the type "Set variables" or the previous input field.  
DDE Field  
Insert a DDE link, which you can insert and update in the document as often as desired via the field code you determined.  
Insert Formula  
Insert calculations or fixed numeric values.  
You select the desired numerical format under Format.  
Input Field  
Insert a new value for an already defined variable or a user field.  
In the case of an input field for a variable, the newly assigned value is always valid from the position where you insert the input field into the document and until the value is changed by inserting another input field.  
In the case of an input field for a user field, the value of the user field is changed globally, i.e., the new value applies to every user field in the document.  
When you click the Insert button, the dialog Input Field appears, where you can enter the new value with an add  
Number Range  
Insert automatic numbering for tables, graphics, and text frames.  
Set Page Variable  
Insert additional page numbers.  
By selecting "on", you determine the reference point; you remove it again with "off".  
Show Page Variable  
Displays the page number with respect to a reference point.  
You determine the reference point with the field type "Set page variables".  
User Field  
Individual definition of a global variable, which can be used to control program executions for example.  
You can change the value of a user field by assigning an input field to it.  
Only global changes are possible and they affect the entire document.  
If no user fields are listed under Selection yet, you must first assign a field name and a value.  
If you then click the Apply icon, the name of the user-defined field appears in the selection field.  
For fields you define yourself, you can either select the desired format from the preset formats or click the entry "Additional formats..." in order to define your own format in the dialog Number format.  
Apart from the usual numbering formats for number ranges or page variables, numbering with the respective lowercase letter (a,... aa,... aaa) or uppercase letter (A...  
AA,...  
AAA) is also available.  
In the Format list box, define if the value should be inserted in a text or numeric format.  
In an HTML document, the fields HTML_ON and HTML_OFF are available for the field type "Set variables" here.  
This causes the set variable for the HTML source text to be converted to an opening (<Value>) or a closing Tag(</Value> )where the entry under Valueis inserted as text between the angled brackets.  
If you double-click an entry while holding the (Ctrl) key or select the desired variable and press the spacebar, it is immediately inserted into your document.  
Formula  
Enter the formula if you selected a field of the type "Insert formula".  
Invisible  
If this check box is marked, the field contents will not be visible in the document.  
Instead of the specified field value, a narrow mark appears in the document.  
This function is only available for the user-defined fields "Set Variable" and "User Field."  
Chapter numbering  
In this area, you can set the options for resetting number ranges by chapter.  
Level  
Choose the heading or chapter level at which to restart numbering in the document.  
Separator  
Enter the character to follow the number of the heading or chapter level.  
Apply  
Click this icon to add the user-defined field to the selection list.  
Delete  
Click this icon to delete a user-defined field from the selection list.  
This is only possible if the respective field does not exist in the document.  
If you have inserted the field in the document, it first has to be deleted before you can remove it from the list.  
Delete  
Database  
This is where you can insert database fields from a database file.  
The field types include, for example, form letter fields.  
These fields insert the field contents connected with the database records when printing the form letter.  
Field type  
Meaning  
Any Record  
Inserts the contents of the record determined under Record Number in the following mail merge field if the Condition is true.  
Only records selected by a multiple selection in the data source view are considered.  
With this field, you can insert the contents of several records on one page of a document.  
You can do this by inserting a field of the type Any Record before the mail merge fields that are to use a certain record.  
Database Name  
Inserts the name of the database file, which can be selected in the field on the right.  
Attention:  
The Field Database Name only exists globally.  
If you change one, all the others in the document will change too.  
Record Number  
Inserts the number of the record currently selected.  
Under Format, choose the desired format.  
Next Record  
Inserts the contents of the next record in the following mail merge field if the condition is true.  
Only records that are selected by a multiple selection in the data source view are considered.  
With these fields, you can insert the contents of several consecutive records on one page of a document by inserting fields of the type Next Record between the mail merge fields where a record change is to take place.  
Mail Merge Field  
Inserts the name of a database field as a placeholder.  
The field content is automatically inserted when printing the form letter.  
Database Selection  
Select a database table or a query to which the field should refer.  
All of the databases registered under %PRODUCTNAME will be offered for selection.  
This enables you to assign the field content of different databases, database tables or queries to a document.  
Fields of the type Any Record and Next Record can be linked to a condition.  
The data of the given or of the next record will only be inserted into the document if the condition is true.  
As entering a condition is optional here, the value True is inserted by default, i.e., the condition is always true if you do not change the condition text.  
Record number  
For the field type "Any record," enter the number of the record to be inserted when the specified Condition is met.  
The record corresponds to the current selection in the data source view.  
For example, if you have a database with 10 records and have selected only the last 5 records, the first record (record 1) of the current record selection will actually be the sixth record in the current table.  
If you refer to the fields of another database (or another table or query within the same database), the record number is determined relative to the current selection.  
If the selection in the current database table excludes the first record, for example, then the record number does not refer to the first but rather to the second record in the other database (or the other table or query).  
Format  
Here, you can choose the format in which the field content is to be inserted.  
These settings can only be chosen for date fields.  
From database  
If you select this option, the formats in the database will be used.  
User defined  
If you select this option, you can choose a user-defined format from the list.  
List of user-defined formats  
All available user-defined formats can be found here.  
Special tags  
Here, you will find an explanation of special tags used for fields.  
When you create HTML documents with fields in %PRODUCTNAME Writer, they are converted into special tags for the HTML source text.  
These tags are not defined in HTML format since they take specific functions of %PRODUCTNAME into account, the fields in this case.  
When importing and exporting HTML documents, you should remember that there are special formats for fields only defined in %PRODUCTNAME.  
The tag for a %PRODUCTNAME Writer field is<SDFIELD>.  
The opening tag contains the options for specifying the field type, the format, and the special field.  
The format of a field tag which is recognized by the HTML filter depends on the special field.  
Document fields of the date or time type  
The SDNUM option specifies the field format.  
DD:MM:YY or HH:MM:SS).  
For fixed date and time fields, the date or the time is specified via the SDVAL option.  
The existence of this option also determines whether the field is a fixed field or not.  
The following table shows through examples which formats for date and clock time fields are interpreted correctly by the HTML filter:  
Fields  
%PRODUCTNAME Tag  
Date is fixed  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DATETIME SDVAL="35843,4239988426 "SDNUM="1031;1031;DD/MM/YY">17/02/98</SDFIELD>  
Date is variable  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DATETIME SDNUM="1031;1031;DD/MM/YY">17/02/98</SDFIELD>  
Time is fixed  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DATETIME SDVAL="35843,4240335648 "SDNUM="1031;1031;HH:MM:SS">10:10:36</SDFIELD>  
Time is variable  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DATETIME SDNUM="1031;1031;HH:MM:SS">10:10:36</SDFIELD>  
In previous versions of %PRODUCTNAME, the formats for date and time fields differ from the ones specified here.  
However, the new format is always exported so that fields are no longer created in older Office versions.  
Examples of the 4.0 format:  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DATE FORMAT=SSYS VALUE="19980217">17/02/98</SDFIELD>  
<SDFIELD TYPE=TIME FORMAT=SYS VALUE="10083682">10:08:36</SDFIELD>  
DocInformation fields  
In the DocInformation fields, the value of the TYPE option is specified as DOCINFO.  
The SUBTYPE option indicates the specific field type.  
The field of the type Created therefore has the SUBTYPE option CREATE; the field type Modified has the CHANGE option.  
Date and time fields are marked by the FORMAT option DATE or TIME; the format of these fields is specified by the SDNUM option.  
In addition, there is the SDFIXED option, which means that the content of the DocInformation field is fixed.  
If a fixed field does not stand for a date or time, the text between the opening field tag ,<SDFIELD> ,and the closing tag ,</SDFIELD>, is used as the contents of the field.  
For date and time fields, the value of the field is specified in a SDVAL option.  
Examples:  
Fields  
%PRODUCTNAME Tag  
Description (fixed content)  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DOCINFO SUBTYPE=COMMENT SDFIXED>Description</SDFIELD>  
Creation date  
Quarter 98</SDFIELD>  
Creation time (fixed content)  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DOCINFO SUBTYPE=CREATE FORMAT=TIME SDVAL="0 "SDNUM="1031;1031;HH:MM:SS AM/PM" SDFIXED>03:58:35 PM</SDFIELD>  
Modification date  
<SDFIELD TYPE=DOCINFO SUBTYPE=CHANGE FORMAT=DATE SDNUM="1031;1031;NN DD MMM, YY">Mo 23 Feb, 98</SDFIELD>  
Input Field  
In this dialog you can specify a user-defined field command.  
There are two types of input fields which can be inserted into the document:  
Function fields for text input, and Variable fields to define new variable values.  
If you reach an input field, the mouse pointer changes to a hand with a pointing index finger.  
Click to open the dialog, and then edit the text or the value in the lower text box.  
Edit  
The upper field displays the text entered under Reference in the Insert Field dialog, and in the lower field you can enter the text or value to be displayed as the field contents.  
Next  
Click this button to jump to the next input field in the document.  
This button is only visible when you position the cursor directly before an input field and press the Shift+Ctrl+F9 keys.  
Formulating Conditions  
Some commands are linked to a condition, allowing you to control the output of document contents.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Writer, conditions are formulated mainly for fields, but sections defined by the display can also depend on a condition.  
Although the following explanation concerns the syntax of a field condition, it also applies to sections.  
Conditions are logical expressions whose syntax is identical in %PRODUCTNAME Writer regardless of context.  
Field conditions can be formulated for the following field types:  
Conditional text: the inserted text depends on a condition; if the condition is true, text A is inserted, otherwise text B is inserted.  
Hidden text: the inserted text is hidden if the condition is true.  
Hidden paragraph: a paragraph in a document is hidden if the condition is true.  
Any record and next record: conditions in these database fields control the access to data for insertion in the document from one or more databases.  
You must formulate a logical expression for each condition, since a condition is always either true (met) or false (not met).  
If a logical expression is false, it is assigned the value 0 (False) in %PRODUCTNAME; if it is true, the value is not equal to 0 (True).  
The simplest way to enter a conditional text is to type in the value directly:  
True  
The condition is always met.  
You can also enter any value not equal to 0 as the conditional text.  
False  
The condition is not met.  
You can also enter the value 0.  
Note that an empty condition field is interpreted as a condition not met.  
Leaving a Condition text box empty or deleting its contents is the same as entering False or 0.  
To formulate a condition, use the same elements as you would use to create a formula: operators, mathematical and statistical functions, number formats, variables and constants.  
Comparative and logical Operators are the basic elements involved in formulating conditions.  
You can formulate a condition with the following variables:  
Self-defined variables ("Set variable" field command or user field)  
Predefined %PRODUCTNAME variables, which use statistical values from the document properties.  
User data  
Database field contents  
You cannot use internal variables (page number, chapter, etc.) to formulate conditions.  
Conditions and Variables  
The x variable can be either the name of the self-defined field command with a set value ("Set variable" or user field) or a %PRODUCTNAME variable whose value depends on the document.  
Examples:  
x == 1 or x EQ 1  
The condition is true if the variable x is equal to 1.  
For example, if you want to formulate a condition for every page in your document, then enter "page" for x:Page == 1 means the condition is true if your document contains only one page.  
x != 1 or x NEQ 1  
The condition is true if the variable x does not equal 1.  
sinx == 0  
The condition is true if the variable x is a multiple of pi.  
Comparative operators can also be used in strings.  
However, they must be set with double quotation marks:  
x == "ABC" or x EQ "ABC"  
Checks whether the variable x contains (true) or does not contain (false) the string "ABC."  
x == "" or x EQ ""  
or  
!x or NOT x  
Checks whether the variable x contains an empty string.  
In this case, both options use the same function.  
The comparative operator "equal" must be represented by two equal signs in the condition, e.g. x==1.  
For example, if you define a variable with the value 1 and enter the condition as FALSE x=1, %PRODUCTNAME cannot evaluate your condition correctly and the result is always "false".  
User Data  
When formulating a condition, you also have access to the user data entered under Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - User data.  
The user data is always in the form of strings, and you can query the contents with "==" (EQ) or "!=" (NEQ) or "!"(NOT).  
User names of the variables for defining user data are:  
Variable  
Meaning  
user_firstname  
First name  
user_lastname  
Last name  
user_initials  
Initials  
user_company  
Company  
user_street  
Street  
user_country  
Country  
user_zipcode  
Zip code  
user_city  
City  
user_title  
Title  
user_position  
Position  
user_tel_work  
Business telephone number  
user_tel_home  
Home telephone number  
user_fax  
Fax number  
user_email  
E-mail address  
user_state  
State (not in all %PRODUCTNAME versions)  
To hide a paragraph, text or area when the user data includes a specific initial, such as "LM", enter the condition as follows:user_initials=="LM ".  
Conditions and Database Fields  
When working with databases, you can formulate conditions to access the contents of a database field.  
You can also formulate conditions to check whether a database field is filled with specific contents.  
You can also formulate logical expressions using comparative or logical Operators.  
Some examples:  
Example  
Meaning  
Database.Table.Company  
or  
Database.Table.Company != "" or Database.Table.Company NEQ ""  
The condition is true if the field name contains COMPANY. (In the first variant, no operator is required.)  
!Database.Table.Company or  
NOT Database.Table.Company  
or  
Database.Table.Company == "" or Database.Table.Company EQ ""  
Returns TRUE if the COMPANY field is blank. (Exclamation point represents a logical NOT.)  
Database table.Company !="Sun Microsystems "or database.table.company NEQ"Sun Microsystems"  
Returns TRUE if the current entry in the COMPANY field does not read "Sun Microsystems".  
Database.Table.Firstname AND Database.Table.Name  
Returns TRUE if the record contains the first and last names.  
Note the difference between the boolean NOT "!" and the comparative operator not equal "!=" (NEQ).  
As you can see from the example above, database fields are indicated in the form Databasename.Tablename.Fieldname. %PRODUCTNAME automatically recognizes that it is dealing with a database field.  
If you do not want it to do so, place the conditional text in quotation marks so that it is interpreted as normal text.  
Hidden Paragraph in a Database Field  
Assume you have inserted the COMPANY form letter field in a document.  
Your address book database would now contain records with an empty COMPANY field, thereby leaving an empty paragraph in your document.  
This paragraph should not appear if the field is empty.  
Select the Hidden Paragraph field and enter the following condition:  
Addressbook.Addresses.Company EQ "" or NOT Addressbook.Addresses.Company.  
If the COMPANY database field is empty, the condition is true and the paragraph is hidden and ignored during printing.  
Mark the check box Tools - Options - Text Document - Formatting Aids - Hidden paragraphs to make hidden paragraphs appear on the screen again.  
Examples of Conditions in Fields  
The various options for formulating conditions are identical for all field commands linked to a condition.  
Below is an explanation of the various options available, using the Conditional text field as an example.  
The syntax of a condition can also be used for the Hidden text, Hidden paragraph, Any record or Next record fields.  
Conditional Text with a %PRODUCTNAME Variable  
Open an empty text document and insert a Conditional text field command with the following parameters:  
Condition:page == 1  
Then:There is only one page  
Or:There are several pages.  
Insert a manual page break (choose Insert - Manual Break) and press F9 to update the field contents.  
Conditional Text with a Self-defined Variable  
Define a "Set Variable" field with the name Profit and the value 5,000, choose the numerical currency format and insert the field in the document.  
Now insert a conditional text field with the following parameters:  
Condition:Profit < 10,000  
Then:Target not met  
Or:Target met  
Change the value from 5,000 to 15,000.  
When you confirm the dialog with OK, the condition is met.  
Conditional Text with a Database Field  
Open data source and display the records.  
Now insert the two form letter fields FIRSTNAME and NAME one after the other in the document.  
Select a record in the data source view and click the Data in Fields icon.  
The field contents of the selected record are included in the document.  
Now insert an empty character between the first name and surname if the record contains a first name;if there is only a surname, the space should not appear.  
Place the cursor between the two fields and insert an additional conditional text field with the following parameters:  
Condition:Addressbook.addresses.firstname  
Then:  
Space  
Or: (nothing)  
A space will now be inserted if there is a first name in your address book.  
If you select a record without a first name in the data source view and click Data in Fields, you will see that only the last name is inserted.  
Use Drag&Drop to move database field conditions to the text field.  
You can use conditions to check the contents of a field name and to see whether it is filled:  
Insert a conditional text field with the following parameters:  
Condition:Addressbook.addresses.firstname == "Michael"  
Then:  
Dear  
Or:  
Hello  
Enter an space after the field and then the first name as form letter field.  
Click this link to see instructions for creating form letters.  
Indexes and Tables  
Here you will find submenus in which the following functions can be carried out: entering a new keyword for an index, creating and designing different indexes and entering entries for a bibliography.  
Entry...  
Indexes and Tables...  
Bibliography Entry...  
Insert Index Entry  
Use this function to call a dialog in which you define the selected text as an entry for a table or index.  
This can be in either a Table of Contents, Alphabetical Index or a User-defined one.  
To subsequently change or edit an index entry, place the cursor on or before the word you inserted as index entry and choose Edit - Index Entry...  
The Apply to all identical texts check box (see below) includes all identical text in the index.  
Identical texts in borders, headers, footers and labels will not appear.  
To include all occurrences of a text in the index, run a multiple search for the text (click the Search All button) and then choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Entry.  
The dialog Insert Index Entry remains visible until you close it.  
While the dialog is visible, you can select more words in the text and then click OK in the dialog.  
The word selected will be added to the index.  
Selection  
In this section, select the index and insert the required entry.  
Index  
This is where you determine the index in which the selected text appears as an index entry.  
Entry  
Enter the text that is to appear in the index.  
The default entry is the text that has been selected in the document.  
You can alter the text in this field and insert entries in the index that do not appear in the text.  
When you place the mouse pointer directly to the right of such an entry in the text, you will see a Help tip containing the name of the index and the text of the entry.  
For this to function you need to activate the Tips or Extended Tips from the Help menu.  
1st key  
To create a multilevel index entry, type the main entry of the first level in this field or select the main entry to which the current keyword should be linked.  
For example, you can enter "Edit" as the 1st key and "Select All" as the entry.  
The following entry will be placed alphabetically in the keyword index - i.e. under E:  
Edit, Select All.  
2nd key  
To create a multilevel index entry, type the main entry of the second level in this field or select the main entry to which the current keyword is to be linked.  
Main Entry  
You can determine that the current text be used as the main entry in the alphabetical index by clicking this field.  
The page number of the text currently selected will be inserted into the index in a different number format than the page numbers of the other entries of this text.  
Level  
Entries with the paragraph format "Heading X" (X = 1-10) can be automatically placed into the table of contents.  
The level of the entry corresponds to the heading level.  
If the entry has been freely defined then you can define the level on which it is to be inserted.  
This function is available only for the table of contents and the user-defined indexes.  
Apply to all identical texts  
If this field is selected, any string that matches the current selection will be identified as an index entry.  
Border text and labels will not be included either.  
To use this function, first mark a text entry in the document and then open the Insert Index Entry dialog.  
If you make manual entries, matching text strings in the document will not be included in the index automatically.  
Match case  
Whole words only  
Insert  
Click here to create an entry or to adopt changes when editing an entry.  
The dialog will not be closed and you can immediately create or edit more entries.

Enter the name of the new user-defined index into this field.  
The new user-defined index will then be included on the Index/Table tab page as a new type for selection.  
Insert Index/Table  
Use this function to insert an index or table of contents into the document at the current cursor position.  
There are several different types available for selection and you can define as many types as necessary.  
Position the cursor in an index or table of contents when you choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Indexes and Tables... to be able to edit it.  
The dialog contains a Preview of the index or table of contents type currently selected.  
If you have partly applied Custom Styles or have altered the default Style, you will be able to see these changes in the preview.  
This dialog contains various tab pages.  
The Index/Table, Entries and Styles tab pages will change depending on the type selected in the Type list box on the Index/Table tab page.  
This is where you define the number of columns for the index or table of contents.  
The title is always one column in width from the left page margin to the right one, unless you have inserted the whole index/table on a multi-columned page.  
Styles  
Specify here the Paragraph Style for index titles, separators and entries of various levels to be used.  
In addition, you can modify Paragraph Styles using this dialog.  
Assignment  
To apply a custom index format, you can assign a different Paragraph Style to each title and index level.  
Levels  
Select the index level for which you want to modify the Paragraph Style.  
Paragraph Styles  
Select the Paragraph Style which you wish to apply to the entry highlighted in the left-hand list.  
Click on Assign to activate the Style.

Under these entries, if desired, the index will be ordered.  
"Match case" means that upper and lower case will be evaluated.  
"Word only" means that the searched term isn't part of a word but word on its own.  
Put a checkmark under "Match case" and/or "Word only" to set them on "Yes".  
If you don't want to use the Edit Concordance File dialog, you can also create it and save it without any special formatting.  
The following format applies:  
Each entry in the concordance file is a separate row.  
Rows starting with # are comments.  
The format of an entry in the concordance file is defined as follows:  
Search term;Alternative entry;1st key;2nd key;Match case;Word only  
The entries "Match case" and "Word only" will be interpreted as "No" or FALSE if they are zero (0) or empty.  
All other contents are interpreted as "Yes" or TRUE.  
If for example, you would like to include the word Boston in your alphabetical index under the "Cities" entry, enter the following line in the concordance file:  
Boston;Boston;Cities;;0;0  
This line finds Boston also in lower case or as part of a word.  
If the Beacon Hill district is also to be included under Cities as an entry for Boston enter the following line:  
Beacon Hill;Boston;Cities;  
If Boston is to be included under the hierarchical entry USA / Cities, the line reads as follows:

Tips for working with bibliography entries.  
Frame  
Use this function to create or edit a multi-columned frame.  
Choose Insert - Frame to call the dialog for defining the frame you want to insert into the document.  
You will only see the Frame command on the Format menu if you have selected an existing frame.  
A selected frame can also be edited by using special shortcut keys.  
If more text is contained in a frame with a fixed height than can be shown, then you can scroll the text in the frame by using the arrow keys.  
Small red arrows at the beginning and the end of the text show that there is more text.  
In the Preview in the Format - Frame dialog, the reference area is flagged with a red rectangle, and the frame itself by a green rectangle.  
The preview also shows you what effect the alignment has on the baseline, line and character in an "as character" frame. "Baseline" is the line on which all the characters on the line stand, "character" is the height of all the characters in the line including tails, "line" is the height of the entire line, including all objects that are attached as characters.  
With frames that are anchored "to characters", there is another reference area: "character".  
This corresponds to the dash of the flashing text cursor, if it is placed before the character selected as the anchor.  
If you select this in a vertical direction, then you can set a fixed distance not only at the top, bottom, center, but also "from below".  
For example "Left/paragraph text area and 0cm/character from below" always positions the frame on the line after the anchor character, at the left text margin.  
Icon in the Insert floating toolbar in the Main toolbar:  
Click the Insert Frame manually icon so that you can drag open a frame in your document.  
Modifying Frames, Graphics and Objects using Keyboard  
The following is a brief explanation of modifying borders, graphics and objects using the keyboard.  
A selected object can be modified with the arrow keys if a border, graphic or OLE object is selected or the cursor is blinking inside a border.  
To move the object completely, use the appropriate arrow key plus the (Option) (Alt) key.  
To modify the size of the object, use the key combination (Command)(Option) (Ctrl)(Alt) and the appropriate arrow key to move the lower-right corner.  
To move the upper-left corner, you must also press the (Shift) key.  
Movement and size modification occurs with the grid increments set under Tools - Options - Text document... Grid  
Absolute positioning cannot be achieved in Web documents, so movement of paragraph-dependent borders is limited to the right/left edge.  
For character-dependent borders, the movement is limited to the top center and bottom.  
Insert Table  
Use this command to insert a table into your document.  
If the cursor is already placed in a table, the Table format dialog will open to format the table.  
You can also insert a table from a different document via the temporary file.  
Complicated formats like connected cells are also kept here.  
Empty lines of connected cells produce neither spaces nor breaks.  
Of course, you can also allocate interesting formats to your new table and frame columns and rows with individual lines.  
If you want to format a text segment as a text table in your text document, select the text and then click the Insert Table icon on the Main Toolbar.  
You can also select the text segment and then choose the Tools - Text<-> Tablecommand, to set some of the table properties in a dialog in advance.  
When inserting values into a %PRODUCTNAME Writer table, they are automatically formatted (e.g. automatic recognition of dates, numbers and times).  
You can however, turn off this automatic option under Tools - Options - Text Document - Table in the Insert in tables area.  
Name  
Enter a name for the new table in this field.  
You can add the default from your application which the table will name TableX (X as consecutive number).  
Table size  
Here, you will find two Spin buttons for entering the number of columns and rows in the new table.  
Columns  
Specify the number of columns for the table.  
Rows  
Choose the number of rows to display in the table.  
Options  
This is where you specify the behavior of the table to be inserted.  
Have a look at the commands found under Format - Table - Text Flow and Tools - Options - Text Document - Table, as well.  
Heading  
Select this option to insert the table heading on the new page at each page break.  
Repeat on each page  
This check box becomes available once you have selected the Heading option.  
If you select this field, the heading is inserted on every following page.  
Do not split the table  
You can prevent the table from being separated by selecting this option.  
Border  
Mark this check box to give the table cells borders.  
AutoFormat...  
Use this button to display the AutoFormat dialog, where you can select a layout for the new table.  
After closing the AutoFormat dialog with the OK button, you return to the Insert Table dialog and the new table with the selected layout is inserted immediately.  
If you click Cancel in the AutoFormat dialog, no layout is applied.  
Icon on the Insert floating toolbar on the Main Toolbar  
If you choose Insert - Table or short click the Table icon, you display the Insert Table dialog, where you can define a table and then insert it into your document by clicking OK.  
Releasing the mouse button inserts it into the document.  
If you already have a table in the document and the cursor is positioned in the table, you can display the Table Format dialog by clicking this icon.  
At the moment there is a limit for the maximum size of a table cell.  
The text contained in a cell cannot exceed the size of a page.  
A page beak is therefore, impossible within a table cell.  
If you scroll through a text document with a table cell larger than a page you hear a warning signal.  
Exchange Database  
Choose this command to exchange the current database used in your document with a different database.  
This should only be used if the database fields to be inserted into your document have identical field names in both databases.  
If you have defined a form letter with address fields from database A, but you now want to send it to an address located in database B, instead of replacing all the inserted fields, you can simply exchange the database.  
Database A's field names, which you have entered in your document, are replaced by field names of the same name from database B.  
Please note the Hints discussed later in this section.  
Replacing a database  
You can only carry out one change per operation.  
Databases in Use  
Here you will find a list of databases currently in use.  
At least one data field from each database in the list was inserted into the document.  
Available Databases  
This field displays all the databases you have registered in %PRODUCTNAME.  
Define  
Click this button to define a new database.  
Exchanging a database in a document for another one  
Both databases must show matching field names and field types, so that after the exchange, the fields for inserting field names still display meaningful results.  
Open the document in which you want to exchange the database fields.  
Open a new document from the "Business Letter" template, as described under Creating Form Letters.  
Choose the Edit - Exchange Database... command to open the Exchange Database dialog.  
In the Used databases list box on the left, select the database table you want to replace, i.e. to overwrite.  
In the Available databases list box on the right, select the table to insert in the document to replace the present contents.  
Click Set.  
You can check the result of the action with the View - Fields menu.  
Insert (File)  
Use this function to insert a text file at the cursor position.  
After selecting this function, a dialog will appear to select a file similar to the Open dialog.  
The contents will be inserted at the position of the text cursor in the current document.  
Insert Script  
Use this function to insert a script at the cursor position in an HTML document.  
If you have already selected an existing script and inserted it into your document, this dialog will be named the Edit Script dialog.  
The inserted script is indicated in the text area by a small green rectangle, provided that the "Notes" option is marked under Tools - Options - HTML Document - View.  
Double-click the green rectangle to open the Edit Script dialog, where you can read and modify the script content.  
The structure of the Edit Script dialog differs from the Insert Script dialog.  
The Edit Script dialog contains two buttons which allow the user to jump between previous or following scripts in the current document.  
These buttons are only visible if at least two scripts have been inserted into the document.  
If you wish, the script can be printed either at the end of the page or at the end of the document.  
Select this option under File - Print... - Options....  
Contents

Insert Horizontal Line  
Use this function to insert a horizontal line at the cursor position.  
The horizontal lines are identical to the graphics in the Rulers Gallery theme.  
If the Rulers Gallery theme is expanded with further files, these will also be offered in this dialog.  
Selection  
Here you can select a type of line (ruler) to insert in your document.  
Click OK to confirm your selection and insert the line.  
Headers  
Use the submenu of this command to select from the current document the Style you want to add a new header to or remove a header from.  
If you are using a completely new document, only the default Style is available.  
Other Styles are only displayed when available.  
Therefore, in the case of a brand new document, you first need to define new Styles, e.g. by using the Stylist or by loading a document containing different Styles.  
Click the name of the Page Style you want to add a header to.  
A checkmark appears in front of the name, and all slides containing that Page Style are given a new empty header.  
The cursor automatically goes to the first of these newly created headers, so that you can enter text immediately.  
This text appears in all headers that have this Page Style.  
If the Page Style already has a check mark next to it on the submenu, then a header for this Page Style already exists.

This tab page also lets you control the line numbering.  
Numbering can be set or reset at any paragraph within a document.This allows you to integrate different numberings with the same formatting in one document.  
It is also possible to integrate tables so that numbering is entered, started, or continued in a table.  
If you change numbering in the Stylist, i.e., edit the paragraph or numbering template, the change has an effect on all paragraphs that are formatted with the respective template.  
However, if you change the numbering in the Paragraph dialog, in the Numbering/bullets dialog, or with the icons in the object bar in the case of numberings, direct formatting is applied and the change affects the respective paragraphs only locally in the document to which this formatting is applied.  
Number Style  
Select the Numbering Style for the paragraph here.  
These styles are also listed in the Stylist if you click on the Numbering Style icon.  
Numbering

You can select the margins, the paper format, portrait or landscape format, headers and footers, division into columns and the order of footnotes.  
You can also determine if your page should have borders or a background.  
Columns  
This is where you define the number of columns to be used on a page, in a frame or a section.  
You can also determine the type, height and position of the column dividers and alter the column widths.  
Default settings  
You can use this dialog to set the number of columns for your document.  
You can also select from several column layouts in Preview.  
The column settings for pages apply to all pages with the active Page Style.  
The column settings for multicolumn frames apply to the current frame or, if the frame style is changed, to all frames based on this style (or a style derived from it).  
Columns  
Enter the number of columns into this field which are to be inserted between the page margins or between the left and right borders of the frame.  
Click one of five selection fields to select a column layout.  
Selection fields

Width  
In the spin boxes, you can modify the width of a column (the respective column number appears above the field).  
The spin boxes are only active when the Automatic width field is not marked.  
Spacing  
This is where you define the spacing between the two columns shown above.  
Automatic Width  
To work with columns that have identical widths, mark this check box.  
The preview for a multicolumn text frame shows only the column distribution of the frame, not the surrounding page.  
Separator line  
This area is active only if there are at least two columns.  
You can separate the columns with separator lines.  
Line  
Here you will find a selection of line widths.  
If you don't want a separator line between the columns, choose None.  
Height  
This spin box is only active if you have selected a line width in the field Type.  
You can define the height of the separator relative to the height of the section in this space.  
The default is a separator from the upper to lower page border.

This field is only active if the value specified in Height is less than 100%.  
Choose between the positions Top, Centerered or Bottom.  
Apply to  
Choose Format - Columns to decide whether the column settings are to be applied to the selected text area (where the cursor is located) or to the Page Style.  
Options  
Use this area to specify the number of text columns and the background in the inserted area.  
You can also specify the type, height and position of the column separator, and the column width.  
Areas in StarWriter cannot contain columns.  
The areas are arranged according to the flow of text at the place in the document below where they are inserted.  
This means that if you insert an area with columns into a page that is itself divided into columns, the result will be nested columns.  
The columns of the area fall within the columns of the page.  
It is also possible to insert one area into another area.  
If both areas have columns, the column subdivision of the superordinate area will just be interrupted and will then continue after the end of the subordinate area.  
The ability to define in areas and columns makes it possible to import and export to other applications in which there are several different column divisions per page.  
Currently, importing and exporting in RTF format and importing in Word format and WordPerfect8 format all support this capability.  
This capability will also soon be added to exporting in Word format.  
Footnote

Graphics  
Use this function to edit the properties of graphics.  
A selected graphic object can also be edited with special shortcut keys.  
The Graphics dialog will appear where you have access to the following tab pages:  
Wrap  
Type  
On this tab page, define the size and position of an object on the page.  
This may refer to a frame, graphics or another object.  
Size  
Here you can define the object size.  
Width  
Define the width of the object in this spin box.  
Relative  
Check this box to define the relative width of the object in the Width spin box.  
The relative width refers to the page width in the online layout table cell width, and print width of a frame.  
In all other cases, the print area of the page is used as the relative reference.  
Height  
Modify the height of the object here.  
Relative  
Check this box to define the height of the object relative to the height of the page print area.  
Keep proportional  
If this check box is selected, modifications to an object are proportional.  
This may be necessary in order to prevent a graphic from being distorted.  
Original Size  
Click here to reset all changes and return to the original view.  
This button is not visible when a frame is selected.  
AutoHeight  
Select this option to automatically adjust the height of a frame to the text it contains.  
If this check box is not selected, the text may exceed beyond the lower border of the frame; the remainder of the text will not be visible.  
This check box is only visible when a frame is selected.  
Anchor  
Choose the type of object anchor here.  
For more information, see Format - Anchor.  
To page  
Select this option to anchor the object to the current page.  
To paragraph  
Select this option to anchor the object to the current paragraph.  
To character  
Select this option to anchor the object to a character.  
As character  
It is positioned within the text flow like a normal letter and affects both the line height and line break.  
Since the horizontal position of the object is determined by the text flow, you can only modify the vertical position (under Position) relating to the respective line.  
Position  
You can modify the object position here.  
The position is always relative, and the reference elements can be page or paragraph margins, depending on the type of anchor.  
For more information, see Format - Alignment.  
Horizontal  
Define the horizontal anchor position here.  
Select the reference element for the alignment in the To combo box.  
If you choose "anchor as character," this function is not available.  
by  
Enter the horizontal distance between the left edge of the selected reference element (in the To combo box) and the left edge of the object to be aligned.  
This field is only active if the From Left option is selected in the Horizontal combo box.  
to  
Choose the reference element for the horizontal alignment here.  
The available options depend on the selected type of anchor.  
When anchoring to the page, paragraph and character, a horizontal alignment relative to the margins, the whole page or the page text area is possible.  
Similarly, when anchoring to a frame, alignment can be relative to a frame border, the whole frame, or the frame text area.  
When frames are anchored to paragraph groups and to characters, there are further reference elements, paragraph borders, paragraph area and paragraph text area.  
The page text area generally corresponds to the paragraph area, the only difference being for multicolumn pages.  
Similarly, the page text area is the page without the margins and the frame text area corresponds to the frame without the frame margins.  
You can see the various definitions by selecting the respective reference element in the Preview box.  
Mirror on even pages  
If this check box is selected, the settings for the horizontal alignment will be reversed on even pages.  
This means that the alignment options left, right, or from left will be evaluated as the exact opposite on even pages.  
For example, if you align an object to the left on an odd page, after a page break it will be aligned to the right on the following page.  
The mirroring applies to both the object as well as the reference element to which the object is aligned.  
This makes it possible, for example, to align a frame or a graphic to the inner edge of the "outer" page margin, i.e., the left page margin for odd pages and the right page margin for even pages.  
When aligning an object that includes graphics e.g. an arrow, you can also use the Pages flip option to adjust not only the position of the object but also the view of its contents to even and odd pages.  
Vertical  
Define the vertical anchor position here.  
Select the reference element for the alignment in the To combo box.  
When anchoring to a frame, remember that vertical alignment only offers the bottom and middle options when the surrounding frame has a fixed height.  
However, when the surrounding anchor frame automatically adjusts to the height of its contents (check box AutoHeight), the inserted frame can only be aligned to the top edge of the surrounding frame.  
by  
Enter the vertical distance between the selected reference element (in the To combo box) and the upper edge of the object.  
This spin box is only active if in the Vertical combo box the "From Top" option is selected or if anchoring as character the "From Bottom" option is selected.  
With the "From Bottom" option, the anchoring as character is the distance to the baseline.  
to  
Choose the reference element for the vertical alignment of the object.  
The available options depend on the selected type of anchor.  
When a character is the selected anchor, you can choose between the following reference elements: baseline, character, row.  
The effects of the different alignments are displayed in the Preview box.  
The base line is the line on which all characters on that line stand, and is displayed in the Preview as a red line.  
The 'character' option refers to the height that covers all characters on the line (including tails).  
The 'row' option refers to the height of the entire row, inclusive of all objects attached as characters.  
A two dimensional reference element used for alignment is indicated by a red rectangle and the aligned object is designated by a green rectangle.  
When a character is used as an anchor, the baseline is indicated by a red line.  
Wrap  
Define a text wrap around an object here.  
This can involve, for example, a frame, a graphic object or a drawing.  
In addition, you can determine the position of an object when changing pages or the distance between the text and an object.  
To wrap text around a table, put the table in a frame and define the wrap around the frame.  
Settings  
Determine in this area how the text and object respond to one another.  
None  
If you choose this option, the text will be interrupted by the frame, picture, or object and continued below.  
The text then ends above the object, regardless of the width of the object, and continues again below it.  
Space remains on both sides of the object.  
None  
Left  
Text wraps to the left of the object if space permits.  
Left  
Right  
Text wraps to the right of the object if space permits.  
Right  
Parallel  
The text wraps to the left and right around the object.  
The flow of the lines is interrupted by the object.  
Parallel  
Through  
Choose this option, to have the text flow behind the object (e.g. frame or graphics.  
The object covers the text.  
Through  
Optimal  
The text wraps to the left, right or not at all, depending on the width and position of the object.  
If the distance between the object and the document border is smaller than 2 cm, a text wrap cannot be made.  
Objects less than 1.5 cm in width and spacing of more than 2 cm on both sides between the object and the document border are assigned a parallel text wrap.  
Optimal  
Options  
The options for the text wrap can be determined here.  
First Paragraph  
Select this function to begin a new paragraph below the object after pressing "Enter".  
The space between the paragraphs is determined by the size of the object.  
For example, this option can anchor the object in the current paragraph so that the text still wraps around the object, and the following object (which can also be a heading) is not placed next to the object but rather below it.  
In Background  
A visual overlapping will appear between the text and the object.  
This option is only active if the Through text wrap type is selected.  
Contour  
If you choose this function, the text flows around the contour of the object itself.  
This function is especially noticeable with polygons.  
If you have already selected the Through text wrap type, this function cannot be activated. %PRODUCTNAME recognizes most contours automatically.  
You can also manually customize the contour in the Contour Editor.  
The Contour Editor can be activated under Wrap in the Format menu of inserted graphics with Edit Contour, or in the context menu of inserted graphics.  
Inserted 3D objects can also be provided with a contour wrap.  
Together with its ability to make text flow inside objects, you can get a very impressive effect.  
What's more, these types of modifiable objects can be incorporated into presentations.  
These functions are not available for a frame.  
Only outside  
If contour wrap is selected, check this box to permit text only to the left and right of the object, but not "within" the object, so the text flow will not be interrupted more than once.  
In a frame, this check box is not visible.  
Gaps  
In this area you establish the individual gaps between the object border and the text.  
The gaps are between the text and the external border of the object when the contour wrap is active between the text and the contour of the object in the designated direction.  
Make sure that you can enter the gaps for the left, right, top and bottom separately and that they refer to the internal fills, if you have not switched the inner contour flow off.  
If you write Drop Caps in %PRODUCTNAME Impress, you can convert them to curves, copy them into the temporary file and insert them in a text document.  
Left  
Here you can determine the amount of spacing between the left edge of the object and the text.  
Right  
Determine the amount of spacing between the right edge of the object and the text here.  
Top  
Use the spin buttons to specify the distance between the top edge of the object and the text.  
Bottom  
Define the distance between the bottom edge of the object and the text.

Editing Tables Using the Keyboard  
This gives you a brief description of how you can easily and conveniently adapt your table to your special requirements with the keyboard.  
You can also achieve most of the functionalities described here with the Object Bar for tables and with the context menu.  
Moving columns and lines  
The (Alt) key initiates moving of lines and columns.  
Together with the corresponding arrow keys, the entire line/column of the table is reduced/enlarged, starting from the right/lower edge.  
If the Shift key is held down at the same time, the right/lower edge is used as the reference edge.  
To move only the currently selected line/column, hold down the (Ctrl) key.  
The way the table or the columns/lines behave when being moved depends on the mode you have selected.  
For example, if to have the column width of all additional columns unaffected when you are enlarging a column, select Variable as the option.  
Inserting and deleting columns and lines  
To insert or delete columns easily and conveniently in your current table, press (Alt) and (Delete/Insert) together, depending on which status you want.  
You have now activated the selected status for about 3 seconds (after you release both keys).  
Now press the appropriate arrow key for the direction the line or column to be inserted or deleted is located within this time interval.  
After you perform the action, or after the time period has expired, the status in question is removed.  
You can specify how tables will behave in text documents on the Tools - Options - Text Document... - Table menu.

Character Style  
Here, you can create a font style.  
Frame Style  
Here you can create a frame style.  
Numbering Style  
Here you can create a Numbering Style.  
The Numbering Styles are organized in the Style catalog offered in the Stylist for creating documents.  
This is why such templates are also called "named" numberings.  
Unnamed numberings, which are used for direct formatting, can be created in the Numbering/bullets dialog or with the icons of the object bar for bullets and numbering.  
Condition  
Define conditions for Conditional Styles here.  
Conditional Styles are Paragraph Styles that have different effects depending on the context.  
When defining a new Style, determine if it should be conditional; you cannot change this property later, but you can change the conditions.  
If a paragraph formatted with a conditional Style is in a Context that has an Applied Style linked to it, then the Paragraph Style from that condition is used.  
If no Style is linked to the Context, then the attributes defined in the conditional Style apply.  
The following example illustrates this relationship:  
Open a blank text document and write a short business letter with a header (Format - Page... - Header).  
Define a new Paragraph Style by choosing New... and selecting all the paragraph properties that you want for your business letter in the Paragraph Style dialog.  
Name this template "business letter".  
Then click the Condition tab and select the Conditional style field to define the new Paragraph Style as a conditional style.  
In Context, select the header entry and under Paragraph Styles select the style for the header in your business letter; for example, the default Paragraph Style "Header".  
You also can select your own style.  
You can apply the Paragraph Style to the context by double-clicking the selected entry in the Paragraph Styles list box or by using Assign.  
Click OK to close the Paragraph Style dialog, and then format all paragraphs in your business letter, including the header, with the new "business letter" conditional Paragraph Style. (When you click in the header, you may need to display all the styles or user styles in the style list to use the new business letter style.)  
The header text now has the attributes you specified in the Header Paragraph Style, while the other parts of the document have the attributes defined in the business letter conditional Paragraph Style.  
The "Text Body" Style was created as a conditional Style.  
Therefore, any Styles you derive from it can be used as conditional Styles.  
The Paragraph Style applied to the context is used when exporting to other formats (RTF, HTML, etc.).  
Conditional style  
Check this box to define a new style as a conditional style.  
Context

Apply  
Choose this command to automatically format the current document.  
When formatting automatically the following rules apply:  
AutoFormat for Headings  
A paragraph is formatted as a heading if there is an empty paragraph above and below it, the line begins with a capital letter and does not end with the punctuation marks, period (.), comma (,) or semicolon(;).  
The header level is determined by the number of spaces and tabs.  
If you place a space at the beginning of the line, a level one heading will be formatted.  
If you place a tab at the beginning of the line, you will also get a level one heading; insert two tabs and the heading is positioned on level two, and so on.  
A level three heading will also be formatted if there is a colon at the end of the line.  
After the format has been selected, the following empty paragraph is removed and the next style for the new paragraph is set.  
AutoFormat for bullets/numbering  
This format can be edited.  
You can use characters in the numbering to stand before or after the bullets/numbering.  
Each level is recognized by its number/separator.  
Automatic numbering is only used in paragraphs formatted with either a "Standard", "Text body" or "Text body indent" paragraph format.  
AutoFormat for Separator Lines  
If you type a paragraph with at least three hyphens (---), underscores (___) or equal signs (===), the paragraph will be replaced by a separator line as wide as the page.  
This line is set up as a lower border for the preceding paragraph.  
The following rules apply:  
Separator line (-) yields a single line, 0.05 pt thick, gap 0.75 mm.  
Underscore (_) yields a single line, 1 pt thick, gap 0.75 mm.  
Equal sign (=) yields a double line, 1.10 pt thick, gap 0.75 mm.

Specify the position of the line numbering in the document here.  
With the right and left option, the numbering will always be arranged at the right or left hand side of the text border.  
The effects of these settings will depend on the page numbering (if they are even or uneven numbers).  
Spacing  
Set the distance between the numbering and the paragraph or text frame here.  
Make sure that you do not define too great a spacing as it could happen that hte line number no longer appear.  
If you are not sure how much space is available you can use the horizontal Ruler as orientation.  
Interval...lines  
Here you can specify the interval for line numbering.  
For example, you can define that every line be numbered, or only every fifth or tenth line.  
Separator  
In addition to the line number, a separator can be defined.  
A separator is any character that is displayed between the numbered lines.  
Since separators are only displayed between line numberings, entering a separator has no effect if you entered numbering for every line.  
Text  
Here you can enter any character to be used as a separator, such as a dash ("-").  
Every...lines  
This is where you can set the space between the separators.  
If you have arranged for numbering to be made every tenth line, you can use this to mark each fifth line with a separator.  
Separators are only displayed in lines where no numbering is displayed.

Moving and Resizing Frames, Graphics and Objects

Option+Command Alt+Ctrl +Arrow Keys

Option+Command Alt+Ctrl +Shift+Arrow Keys  
Resizes by moving top left corner.  
Positioning Objects  
There are various ways of anchoring the objects on a text page, such as graphics and text frames.  
We will describe the various options, based on the example of a frame:  
Anchoring  
Effect  
as a Character  
Frames are placed in the document like any other character, hence, they have an impact on the line size of the line and the line break.  
to Character  
Frame is with its X and Y coordinates associated to a character, for example, in the X direction always to the margin and in the Y direction always to the height of the character (marginal frame).  
The frame should be set at "Flow".  
to Paragraph  
Frame is associated to a paragraph, changes its position with the paragraph.  
on the Page  
Frame has always the same position in relation to the page margins.  
on Frame  
Frame is inside the superior frame in a fixed position.  
The position in relation to the anchor can be chosen through various possibilities.  
For example, it is possible to set the frame on a fixed position in relation to a page margin, to a paragraph margin, to a text area, etc.  
The frame position on even pages can be automatically mirrored, so that a fixed position in relation to the right side of the page produces a corresponding position on the left side of the page.  
For example, you can position a graphic always inside the outer edge of pages.  
Where the graphic is, say, an arrow pointing to the text, it is a good idea to mirror this automatically on even pages too.  
To do this, use the Mirror on even pages option on the Type tab of the Graphics dialog (choose Format - Graphics).  
Chapters in Navigator  
In long documents, you can use the Navigator to obtain an overview and change the sequence of chapters or their level in the hierarchy of chapters and sub-chapters.  
The only condition is that you must apply "Heading" Paragraph Styles to the chapter headings (or enter the Paragraph Styles you have chosen for your headings under Tools - Outline Numbering).  
Navigator as variable-size window or minimized  
Hold down (Command) (Ctrl) and double-click on the gray area at the edge of the Navigator, e.g. next to or below the icons.  
This docks the Navigator against the side of the window, or turns it back to a variable window whose size and position you can select for yourself by dragging and dropping with the mouse.  
The size and position are automatically remembered.  
Double-click to switch between docked and variable Navigator windows.  
Inside the Navigator, double-click on a heading to move the cursor to the relevant point in the text.  
Drag and drop to change the sequence of chapters.  
You can also do this by clicking on the Promote Chapter and Demote chapter icons.  
The content of the chapters and of the relevant sub-chapters is of course also moved.  
If you want to move the chapter headings without moving their contents, drag and drop while holding down the (Command) (Ctrl) key. (The Drag Mode icon only affects drag and drop behavior between Navigator and document).  
When using this function, switch on Heading Levels Shown by clicking on the relevant icon in the Navigator, so that you can see what is happening in the document.  
AutoText With AutoComplete  
1.  
In the AutoText dialog, mark Display remainder of name as suggestion while typing.  
2.  
When you enter a word in the text that exists as an AutoText name, after the third matching letter is typed a Help tip will appear containing the whole name of the AutoText.  
3.  
Press Enter to insert the AutoText.  
If you see a Help tip containing several AutoText names that begin the same way, use (Command) (Ctrl) (Tab) to scroll forwards and (Shift) (Command) (Ctrl) (Tab) to scroll backwards through the AutoText names.  
Edit - AutoText  
Word Completion  
Exceptions in AutoCorrect  
If AutoCorrect corrects a word you have entered, and if you do not want this correction, you can restore the word using the Undo function.  
This word will also be placed in the list of exceptions in AutoCorrect, if AutoInclude is marked in the AutoCorrect dialog. (By default it is marked.)  
Example  
By default, AutoCorrect automatically corrects two capitals at the start of a word.  
But in the case of product names and the like you might actually want two initial capitals.  
AutoCorrect will automatically change this to "Est".  
Press (Command) (Ctrl) (Z).  
This will undo the automatic replacement and the word "ESt" is automatically included in the list of exceptions in the AutoCorrect Dialog.  
Automatic Numbering/Bullets  
%PRODUCTNAME also automatically recognizes bullets and numbering during entry if you have previously chosen Format - AutoFormat - While Typing.  
Numbering that uses Roman numerals is also recognized and continued.  
The list can start with any value: e.g., you do not have to begin with 1. or a. or I. etc.  
An example with Roman numerals  
Enter I. (with a period after it), also followed by a space and text.  
You can also use a right parenthesis here instead of a period.  
Press the Enter key to create a new paragraph.  
The new paragraph will begin with II., i.e., the Roman numeral for two.  
Enter some text, press the Enter key and the next paragraph will begin with III. and so forth.  
You can begin your Roman numbering with any numeral you want, for example, with ci (corresponds to 101), followed by cii (102) etc.  
Format - Numbering/Bullets  
Turning Off AutoCorrect Function  
By default, %PRODUCTNAME Writer corrects many common typing errors.  
However, you may not always want this.  
You can undo any automatic correction immediately after it is made, for example by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (Z)  
Below we indicate the places in %PRODUCTNAME where you can turn off automatic corrections (and turn them on again):

The context menu often provides a list of suggested words, one of which you may click on to select it.  
The suggested word then replaces the word underlined in red.  
If you replace the wrongly typed word using the AutoCorrect function in the context menu, the word pair will be entered in the AutoCorrect replacement table.  
To call up this table, choose Tools - AutoCorrect/AutoFormat - Replace tab.  
If the word underlined in red is correct, you can place it in your custom dictionary using the Add command.  
To exclude words from the spellcheck:  
Select the words.  
Open the context menu of one of the words.  
Choose Character.  
Choose Format - Character - Font tab.  
Now select the language [None].  
Creating a new dictionary.  
Using AutoText  
%PRODUCTNAME Writer contains an AutoText function which allows you to compose whole texts for letters, faxes or any other documents by entering predefined or user-defined shortcuts.  
To insert AutoText you can:  
Enter the shortcut for an AutoText item and press the F3 key.  
Some predefined AutoText blocks are provided.  
For example, enter DT and press F3 to insert a dummy text which can be used to check the look of a page filled with text (and other objects).  
Enter FN and press F3 to insert a %PRODUCTNAME Math formula with sequential numbering at the right border.  
Choose Edit - AutoText.  
The AutoText dialog contains a number of AutoTexts.  
As you will see, AutoTexts can even contain graphics and tables.  
Long-click on the Edit AutoText icon on the main toolbar and select an AutoText.  
You can also use the AutoComplete function.  
Directions for using this function are found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Move the mouse pointer to the AutoText that you want to insert in the text at the cursor position.  
When you release the mouse button, the text is inserted.  
Defining AutoText  
It may contain formatting and embedded graphics.  
Now, click briefly on the AutoText icon in the Main Toolbar.  
In the large list box, select the category (e.g. 'Default'), assign a name for the new text component in the text box and correct the abbreviation if necessary.  
You may now save the text component via AutoText - New; afterwards, you should close the dialog.  
Using AutoText in Networks  
You can use AutoTexts from different directories.  
An example would be in a typical %PRODUCTNAME network installation:  
Read-only "company AutoTexts" could be in a directory on the server, while you write and read your own, user-defined AutoTexts in your own files.  
Choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths.  
Double-click AutoText.  
Two paths have been entered here.  
The second path takes the AutoTexts from your user directory.  
If two AutoTexts from two different directories have the same name, %PRODUCTNAME will use the AutoText from your user directory.  
Printing AutoTexts  
The macro lists all AutoText names and shortcuts in a new text document.  
Choose Tools - Macro, double-click "Gimmicks" in the right list of the Macro dialog, select "AutoText" and then click Run.  
Editing - AutoText  
Word Completion  
Calculating With Formulas Located in Text  
If you already have a formula in your text, you can enter the result into your text without using the Formula bar.  
In the text, select the calculation formula, which must not contain anything other than figures, arithmetic operators and any currency symbols.  
Example:  
12 + 24 * 2  
Press Command Ctrl +plus sign, or choose Tools - Calculation.  
The calculation result will be stored on the clipboard.  
Place the cursor at the point where you want to insert the result of the calculation and press Command Ctrl +V, or choose Edit - Insert.  
In the example, 60 is inserted.  
If the formula is still selected at the time of insertion, the result replaces the formula.  
Calculating Cell Totals in Tables  
Insert a table with multiple rows (Insert - Table) into a new text document.  
Enter a series of numbers into a column, one number per row, leaving the last cell of the column empty.  
Position the cursor in the last empty cell of the column, and click the Sum icon in the Table object bar.  
The Formula bar appears, and a formula indicates the cells of the column to be added.  
The cells are separated by a vertical slash (_BAR_).  
Press the Enter key to confirm, or click Apply in the Formula bar.  
The sum will appear in the last cell.  
If you change the numbers in the table, the sum will automatically be updated.  
If, for example, you want to format the numbers as currency, select the cells and choose Number Format from the context menu.  
The Number Format dialog appears, where you can choose a new format.  
Performing Calculations With Tables in Text Documents  
You can carry out calculations in %PRODUCTNAME Writer tables.  
With calculations that go beyond the current table, the table name serves as a clear table identifier.  
To multiply the first cell of Table1 by the first cell of Table2 and return the result in cell A2 in the current table, position the cursor in cell A2 in the current table, press  
=<Table1.A1> *<Table2.A1>  
With the help of the Navigation Bar you can navigate quickly and easily between the table formulas in your document.  
If a table formula refers to an invalid table cell, a "**Faulty expression**" is displayed in the cell.  
Invalid table cells are either deleted cells or those which are themselves faulty.  
To add cells B1:B10 from Table1 and see the result in the single-cell Table2 (which should be somewhere in your text), do the following:  
Create the text and Table1.  
Write the text where you want the result to appear.  
Now insert a frame (Insert - Frame menu command).  
In the Frame dialog select the character to be used as an anchor, and deselect the border.  
You can deselect the frame by clicking outside it; when you want to enter text in the frame, click in the very center of the frame.  
The frame should not be selected, but the text cursor should be inside the frame.  
Insert the single-cell table inside the frame (Insert - Table).  
Select a row and a column and click OK.  
The cursor is positioned in Table2.  
Define the mathematical formula by entering an equal sign.  
You can see the Calculation Bar.  
Select the cells in Table1 in which the "summand" formula is positioned; keep the button pressed as you drag the mouse from the first to the last cell you want.  
The formula for calculating the total of cells B1 to B10 is: =<Table1.B1:B10>  
Close the mathematical formula by clicking the Accept icon on the Calculation Bar.  
You will see the result of the calculation in Table2.  
After making changes to the "summands", you can update the result by pressing function key (F9).  
Instead of first inserting the border and then inserting a table inside the border, you can start by inserting a single-cell table, then select the whole of this cell - the only way to do this is with the shortcut keys (Command) (Ctrl) (A) - and then click on the Insert - Frame icon.  
The border automatically surrounds the table (incidentally, this also works with any section of text).  
Now you can set the anchor to character, cut the whole table to the clipboard and paste it where you want, remove the borders from the frame and table and apply further settings.  
Calculating in Text  
Place the cursor at the position in the text where the calculation result should appear.  
Press (F2) to display the Formula bar.  
Enter the desired formula, for example (4+6)*100.  
Press Enter or click on Apply to insert the result.  
Use the Formula icon to perform more complex calculations.  
Clicking on this icon opens a branched submenu from which you can select a formula.  
The formulas are placed on the formula bar at the cursor position, and you are free to switch between inputting formulas and values from the keyboard and via the Formula icon.  
As an example of a more complex calculation to be performed in a text, suppose we want to calculate the mean value of three figures.  
Display the Formula bar with (F2).  
Open the submenu of the Formula icon.  
Choose "Median" from the statistical functions.  
The input field will display "=median."  
Enter the first number and then a vertical slash (_BAR_) as the list separator.  
Enter the second number, another separator and then the third number.  
The input field may now show, for example, "=median 12_BAR_22_BAR_34."  
Press Enter, and the result appears in the text.  
It is inserted as a field.  
Double-click on the field to edit it.  
Calculating Across Multiple Tables  
In a text document, insert two tables each with several rows and columns.  
Enter a few figures in the tables, but leave at least one cell empty.  
The tables were automatically named "Table1" and "Table2".  
You can give a table a different name (Format - Table, Table tab, text box Name).  
Use only letters and numbers in the name.  
Position the cursor in an empty cell.  
Press (F2) to display the Formula bar.  
As an example, enter SUM.  
Now you can click in both tables in the cells containing figures.  
After each click, enter a plus sign (+) from the keyboard, then click on the next cell containing a figure.  
Finally, click the Apply icon on the Formula Bar.  
If, for example, you want to add up the first two rows of each table and show the total in Table2, the formula is =sum<Table1.A1>+<A1>.  
Calculating in Text Documents  
You can enter calculations in your text documents, both in running text and in tables that you have created in the text documents.  
Press function key (F2) within any table cell or anywhere in the text to show the formula bar.  
Within a table, all you have to do is enter an equals sign.  
This is the signal that you want to enter a calculation formula.  
Press (F2) again or (Esc) to hide the formula bar again.  
To perform calculations directly within the text  
Type, for example, the following: "$10000 per year is $per month."  
Place the cursor at the point where you want to insert the result and press (F2).  
You will now see the formula bar.  
The cursor is already waiting there for your entry.  
Type 10000/12 and press Enter.  
The result of the calculation is inserted in the text.  
Numbering Illustrations by Chapters  
To number illustrations by chapter, so that illustrations are labeled "Illustration 1.1", "Illustration 1.2", etc. in the first chapter and "Illustration 2.1", "Illustration 2.2", etc. in the second, proceed as follows.  
Organize your document by chapters if you have not already done so.  
Choose Tools - Outline Numbering to number the chapter headings that you have formatted, for example, with the Paragraph Style "Heading 1".  
Select the "Heading 1" Style from the Paragraph Style list box and the option "1, 2, 3,.." from the Number list box below it.  
Select the first illustration you want to number.  
Choose Insert - Caption....  
In the dialog that appears, select Illustration as the category and Arabic (1 2 3) as the numbering.  
You also can enter your caption text in this dialog.  
Click Options.  
Specify the chapter numbering in the Number Range Options dialog.  
For this example, select option "1" under Level and specify the separator you want for chapter-wise numbering.  
Click OK.  
Your illustrations are now numbered by chapters.  
Do the same for all other illustrations in your document.  
All illustrations within one chapter level are numbered, and you can enter at which chapter level you want the numbering to switch in the Number Range Options dialog.  
Choose Tools - Options - Text Document - General, and under Caption mark the Automatic check box.  
When you click the button next to Object selection, the Caption dialog appears.  
This is where you can, for example, determine that from now on all illustrations in text documents receive a caption automatically.  
Captions and Number Ranges  
In text documents you can create separate, continuously numbered captions for figures, tables and drawing objects.  
You can also define as many separate number ranges as you like.  
The captions are linked to the figures, tables or drawing objects in a frame.  
Select the frame when you move the object.  
Defining Captions  
Select the figure or the object or place the cursor in the table for which you want to insert a caption.  
Open the Caption dialog with the command Insert - Caption.  
The dialog shows you a preview of how the caption will look.  
You can add further text in the Caption field.  
Click OK.  
If you would like to place a tab stop between the automatic captions (e.g., "Figure 1") and the additional text, you can insert it in the document later.  
Press Ctrl+Tab to insert a tab stop at the beginning of a paragraph.  
The paragraph format of the automatically applied caption is obtained from the Paragraph Style "Illustration", "Table", "Drawing" or "Text".  
All of these Paragraph Styles are derived from the "Caption" Paragraph Style.  
So if you want all captions always to appear in green, for example, simply modify the "Caption" Paragraph Style accordingly in the Stylist.  
Switch the Stylist to the "All Styles" view or to the hierarchical view.  
Editing or deleting captions  
A caption is normal text which is placed together with an object in a common frame.  
Edit the caption text just like normal text.  
Delete the caption text just like normal text.  
Inserting an object in a number range  
Now you want to add a drawing obtained with the drawing tools as a further illustration.  
Below the additional illustration, insert a new line and apply the Paragraph Style "Illustration."  
Start the Fields dialog, by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (F2) for example.  
On the Variables tab select the Type "Number range".  
Under Selection select "Illustration".  
Click Insert and close the dialog box.  
If you move illustrations with your captions by hand so that the sequence changes, it may be necessary to update the numbers by pressing F9.  
Page Styles From Selection  
A new Page Style is often needed, for example because the header changes as the text moves on to a new chapter.  
The header is linked to the Page Style.  
Very often, none of the other style attributes are changed, therefore you should create such a style using the "New Style from Selection" function in the Stylist.  
The new style automatically assumes all attributes of the style from the page in which the cursor is positioned.  
Suppose you have created a Page Style with a particular header text and have typed several pages.  
On the next page you want a different header text to appear.  
Switch the Stylist to Page Styles.  
In the Stylist, select New Style from Selection to define a new Page Style to be applied to the following pages.  
Choose Insert - Manual Break.  
Under Type select Page break and select the new style from the list box.  
Enter the new header in any of the new pages.  
This will then appear on all pages with this Page Style.  
Outline Numbering  
To number your headings automatically, choose Tools - Outline Numbering.  
By default, the Paragraph Style "Heading 1" is assigned to the highest level of Outline Numbering.  
If you select a Numbering Style from the Number combo box, then all paragraphs in your document that have the "Heading 1" format will have consecutive numbers placed in front of them.  
If you have created your own Paragraph Styles and you would like to use these for your headings, you can apply the styles in this dialog to the individual levels.  
In the Level list box select 1 and in the Paragraph Style combo box select Head1.  
Click OK.  
Now, all paragraphs with Head1 applied to them will be listed in the Navigator under "Headings".  
You can rearrange the chapters in the Navigator if you want to change their order or their place in the hierarchy and thus also the numbering.  
Click on one of the icons Promote Chapter, Demote Chapter, Promote Level and Demote Level, or  
move the chapter heading in the Navigator using the mouse.  
The numbering of all affected chapters is adjusted automatically.  
Conditional Text for Page Counts  
How can the word "page" be displayed in singular or plural, depending on the number of pages in a text document?  
To ensure that the word "Page" is modified based on the actual number of pages, use the Conditional text field.  
Proceed as follows:  
1.  
Place the cursor on the position in the document where the pagination is to be shown.  
2.  
Go to the Insert - Field - Page Count menu item.  
The page count will be inserted into the document.  
Directly after this, enter a space.  
3.  
Go to the Insert - Field - Other menu item.  
Select the Functions tab and click the Conditional text entry under Field Type.  
4.  
In the Condition field, enter: "Page > 1" (but without inverted commas).  
In the Then field, enter: "Pages." In the Otherwise field enter: "Page".  
5.  
Click Insert to insert the field into the document, then click Close to exit the field dialog.  
The correct form of the word Page/Pages will appear based on the number of pages.  
Press (F9) to perform an update.  
Conditional Text  
Otherwise, you want a different paragraph to appear.  
A reminder letter is a good example, because the text in the third letter would be formulated differently than the first.  
You can use the "Conditional text" field command for this purpose.  
To insert a line indicating "Reminder 1" through "Reminder 3" at the top of your reminder, enter the number as a self-defined variable in a field command.  
Place the cursor where you want the number to appear in the document.  
Open the Fields dialog with (Command) (Ctrl) (F2) and click on the Variables tab.  
Choose the field type "Set variable."  
In the Name text box, enter a name for the variable ("Reminder").  
Select the Text option as the variable format.  
In the Value field, enter "1" and click Insert.  
Place the cursor at the position in the text where you want to insert the conditional text.  
The Fields dialog remains visible.  
From the Functions category, choose the field type "Conditional text."  
For the condition, enter:  
Reminder EQ "3".  
A list of operators permitted in this kind of logical query can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
The number 3 appears in quotation marks, which means that the text character is relevant, not the numerical value.  
If Number had been selected instead, the decimal places would be set to the standard format for numbers, and the heading would then appear as "Reminder 3.00", which would be unusual.  
Instead of Text format you can also select "1234567" format, to display integers only.  
Under Then, enter the text you want to display for the final reminder.  
The Else field contains the text that should otherwise be displayed.  
The text can be as long as you want and can be copied from any document.  
Click Insert and close the dialog.  
If you want, you can hide or reveal fields by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (F9).  
If you later need to insert a line for a second or third reminder, place your cursor directly in front of the "1" field and select the Edit - Fields command (or double-click on the field).  
Enter a "2" or "3" instead of "1," and close the dialog.  
If you enter a "3," the "Then" condition will be fulfilled for the conditional text and the final reminder text will be inserted.  
If you don't see this text, press (F9) to update the document.  
Removing Words From User-Defined Dictionaries  
Choose Tools - Options - Language Settings - Writing Aids tab.  
Select the user-defined dictionary and click Edit.  
Now you will see the Edit User-Defined Dictionary dialog, in which you can search through an alphabetic list.  
Select the word and click on Delete.  
Moving Text Sections in Documents  
Select the text that you want to move.  
Place the mouse pointer in the selected text, then press the mouse button and keep it pressed.  
Drag the mouse until a symbol appears next to the pointer, indicating that the selected area will be moved.  
In addition, a gray text cursor moves with the mouse pointer, indicating where the selection is to be inserted.  
Mouse Pointer Shape  
Meaning  
Moving  
Copying  
If you do not want to move the text, but rather only copy it, press Command Ctrl while performing this action.  
This is indicated by a plus sign next to the mouse pointer.  
You can press and release the Command Ctrl key as often as you like - the action applies to the condition prevailing at the time you released the mouse button.  
Alternating Page Styles on Odd and Even Pages  
Suppose you want to have different contents in the headers and footers on even pages (left pages) than on odd pages (right pages).  
The Page Styles determine what your headers and footers look like.  
Use different Page Styles for left and right pages.  
Define your left Page Style with a right page as Next Style, and vice versa.  
Open the Stylist.  
In the Stylist click on the Page Styles icon.  
Click on the Left Page style, then open the context menu there.  
Select Modify.  
This opens the Page Style: Left Page  
Click on the Organizer tab.  
In the Next Style box, select Right Page.  
You can modify the Right Page style in the same way, setting Next Style to Left Page.  
Apply the Page Style Right Page to the first page of your document.  
To do this, for example, place the cursor in the first page of your document, then go into the Stylist and double-click on the Page Style Right Page.  
The status bar always tells you which Page Style is set.  
If you want a title page containing no header or footer, this is how to do it:  
Modify the First Page style, setting Next Style to Left Page.  
Apply the Page Style First Page to your title page.  
Insert Break dialog  
Converting Fields into Text  
Now you want to convert this date with its gray background (because it is a field) into normal text.  
Place the cursor immediately next to the field.  
Type the content of the field (in this case the date).  
Delete the field.  
Alternatively, use the clipboard, as follows:  
Select the field (in this case the date).  
Cut the field to the clipboard, for example with Edit - Cut.  
Long-click the Insert icon on the function bar.  
Select Unformatted Text from the submenu.  
The text contained in the field is pasted.  
Edit - Paste Special  
Inserting a Fixed or Variable Date  
This is how you can insert a variable date in %PRODUCTNAME Writer.  
Choose Add - Fields - Other... and select the Date field on the Document tab.  
The variable date field according to the current date and system time will be displayed every time you open the document and update the fields.  
On the contrary, the Date (fixed) field will add a date that always follows the current date at the time of adding.  
When the document is opened or updated on a different date, the fixed date remains unchanged.  
Entering Input Fields in Text  
Here's how to create a text document with input fields, so that the cursor immediately jumps to the next field.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Writer, use the Input field command (choose Insert - Fields - Other and the Functions tab) to insert these input fields at points in the document where the user should be able to insert variable text.  
Use the shortcut keys (Ctrl)(Shift)(F9) or double-click on the field to start a dialog which allows you to change the content.  
Querying User Data in Conditions  
In field formulas or conditions, you also have access to the user data.  
User data are strings which you can compare with the following operators:  
Operator  
Meaning  
== or EQ  
equals  
!= or NEQ  
is not equal to  
Further operators can be found in %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
To hide an area from user Doe:  
Select the text that the user with surname Doe is not supposed to see.  
Choose Insert - Section.  
Mark Hide and With condition.  
Enter the condition in the text box:  
user_lastname == "Doe"  
Click on Insert and save the document.  
If that user opens the text document, he will not be able to see this section.  
The name of the section can be seen in the Navigator.  
If a different user opens the same text document, he can see the section.  
The following table shows the user variables.

Using Fields  
Field commands are used, for example, to insert the current date, page number, total page numbers, a cross-reference to another area of text, the content of certain database fields, and many other variables (i.e., fields with changing values) into your document.  
The main advantage in using fields is that %PRODUCTNAME controls the display of field contents and updates the information automatically.  
How are field commands displayed?  
Field commands generally consist of a field name and a field content.  
With the menu command View - Fields you can switch the between the display of field names or field contents.  
If the Fixed Content field is activated, "fix" will be added to the field name.  
You can turn the colored highlighting of fields on and off by choosing Tools - Options - Text Document - View and selecting the Highlighting Fields option.  
You can also turn the highlighting on and off by choosing View - Field Shadings.  
Special %PRODUCTNAME defined tags apply to field commands for HTML import and export.  
What properties do field commands in text documents have?  
Different types of field commands work differently according to the function in the document.  
Most fields are used to store variable values and insert them "as is" into the document.  
These values can be document or database information.  
Some fields execute an action when the mouse is clicked.  
You can recognize these fields when you move the mouse pointer over them and it changes into a hand.  
The actions can be defined differently depending on the field type.  
The options are as follows:  
Field Type  
Property  
Placeholder  
A mouse click opens a dialog to insert the object for which the placeholder was set.  
Insert Reference  
A mouse click positions the cursor on the set reference.  
Run macro  
A mouse click starts the macro.  
Input Field  
A mouse click opens a dialog to edit the contents.  
Additionally, for some field types either a short Help tip or the name of the field is displayed when you rest your cursor on the field.  
In the Fields dialog, you can specify the name or text to be shown.  
This applies for variables, database fields, user-defined fields and the fields "Placeholder," "Hidden Text" and "Insert Reference".  
How are fields updated?  
Usually, you can press the F9 key to update the fields in a document.  
For inserted database fields, first select the field and then press the F9 key.  
To update all fields in a document, choose the Edit - Select All Command Ctrl + A, command and press the F9 key.  
Editing Text With FontWork  
The FontWork program module is used for graphical text effects.  
This is what you do:  
1.  
Open the Drawing Functions floating toolbar from the Main toolbar and click the Text icon.  
2.  
Draw a text frame on your page, and then type in text, for example "FontWork".  
3.  
Choose Format - FontWork.  
This opens the FontWork window, from which you select the desired effects:  
4.  
Click the upper-left icon with the semicircle to display the text as a curve.  
5.  
Click Vertical in the Shadow options.  
Specify 0.10 inches for the x-axis shadow distance.  
The text should now appear similar to the illustration.  
6.  
Since the first and last letters are not very easy to see, insert two blank spaces before and after the text.  
Double-click the text, edit it, and then click outside the object.  
7.  
When you select the FontWork object, eight handles appear.  
To change the size and shape of an object, simply drag one of the handles in the desired direction.  
Additionally, you can copy the finished object to the clipboard and paste it from there into other documents where you can also modify its size and other attributes.  
Format - FontWork  
Inserting Page Numbers of Continuation Pages  
With Insert - Footer, insert a footer.  
Set your cursor in the footer and in your main menu go to Insert - Fields - Other....  
Under "Type" select "Page", under "Select" select "Next page" and under "Format", select "As Page Style".  
Finally click Fields to insert the field command in the footer of your current document.  
In your document you'll have displayed the page number of the next page, with the exception of the last page.  
If the word "page" should also appear in front of the page number, insert another field of the same type but with another format:  
Set the cursor in front of the field that you just inserted in the document and call the Fields dialog.  
Again, select a field of the "Page" type, under Select, select "Next page" and under "Format", select "Text".  
In the Value text box, enter the text to be displayed if a next page exists in the document.  
Enter "Continue on page" (note the space at the end!) and click Insert.  
For example, "... /", to indicate the number of the next page.  
Inserting Page Numbers in Footers  
Insert a footer.  
Choose Insert - Footer and select from the submenu the Page Style you would like for the footer.  
The cursor now appears in the footer.  
Choose Insert - Fields - Page Numbers.  
The page number appears as a field in the footer.  
Select the page number and click on the Centered icon on the object bar.  
If you would like the footer text to be in the form "Page 9 of 12", you should also do as follows:  
Type the word "Page" before the field and "of" after the field.  
Choose Insert - Fields - Page Count.  
Inserting and Editing Footnotes  
You can insert a footnote in two ways: with an icon or with a dialog.  
This is how to insert a footnote with an icon  
1.  
Place the cursor in the text at the point where the footnote anchor should appear.  
2.  
Open the Insert floating toolbar on the main toolbar.  
3.  
Click on the Insert Footnote Directly icon.  
This is how to insert a footnote with a dialog  
Place the cursor in the text at the point where the footnote anchor should appear.  
Choose Insert - Footnote to open the Insert Footnote dialog.  
The Insert Footnote dialog on the other hand allows individual settings for the footnote.  
Tips for Working with Footnotes  
To edit the text of a footnote, click in it and then you can modify it.  
Press (PgUp) to jump from the footnote area to the footnote anchor in the text.  
To edit the properties of a previously inserted footnote, place the cursor in the document immediately before the footnote character and choose Edit - Footnote or double-click immediately before the footnote character.  
To define general settings applied automatically to footnotes in the document, choose Tools - Footnotes to open the Footnote Settings dialog.  
You can format footnotes with Page Setup by choosing Format - Page... - Footnote.  
In multicolumn pages, the footnote is inserted in the column where the footnote anchor is situated.  
You can also use the mouse to jump from the footnote anchor to the footnote.  
The mouse pointer changes its appearance as soon as it is over the footnote anchor.  
Spacing Between Footnotes  
If you want a bigger distance between the different footnotes or endnotes, you can add an invisible (white) line as the lower border to the corresponding paragraph format:  
Place the cursor in a footnote.  
Open the Stylist.  
Click on the Paragraph Style to be modified (footnote).  
Open the context menu and select Modify.  
On the Borders tab page, select a top and a bottom line and give them both the color white.  
In the Spacing to contents area, unmark the Synchronize check box.  
Increase the value of the upper or lower spacing.  
Click OK.  
Format - Paragraph - Borders  
Using Master Documents and Subdocuments  
You can either create a new empty master document by choosing File - New - Master Document, or create a master document from an existing document by choosing File - Send - Create Master Document.  
You can open a master document by choosing File - New - Master Document.  
The new master document is opened as an empty text document.  
You will immediately see the Navigator in global mode.  
The Navigator in master mode provides the functions you need for navigating and editing.  
Double-click a document in the Navigator to load it for editing.  
When opening an existing master document, note the extension ".sxg", which distinguishes a master document from "normal" %PRODUCTNAME Writer documents in the Open File dialog.  
There is a sample master document provided with the %PRODUCTNAME samples.  
Now you can either enter text, e.g., for headings, or insert subdocuments, by clicking the icon Insert and choosing the desired entry Text or File.  
You can also insert a new document with the entry New document; in this case, first enter a name and a path; after that, you can write the new document and save it.  
Paragraph Styles you define and use in the subdocuments are automatically adopted in the master document.  
If you save the master document afterwards, these Styles will be available everywhere in the master document.  
The Styles defined in the master document have priority over Styles with the same name in subdocuments.  
It is a good idea to base all subdocuments and the master document itself on the same document template.  
If a new Style is needed in the documents now, you simply have to add it to the document template and reload the master document.  
Then the new Style can be applied to all documents automatically.  
Use Page Styles, if you want all subdocuments to always start on a new page (e.g. always on a new right page).  
We included a Page Style called "Right page" that you can, for example, link to the Paragraph Style "Header 1".  
If you assign a page break to the Paragraph Style "Header 1", every "Header 1" will always be at the top of a right page.  
As the Next Style assigned to the Page Style "Right page" you now choose "Left page" and vice versa.  
If the cursor is positioned in a text in the master document, the entry Text is shaded gray because consecutive texts are always combined to one single text.  
Between individual inserted documents, you can insert new text.  
However, you can easily change their order with Drag&Drop or with the icons Move down and Move up.  
The inserted documents are inserted in the master document as protected areas.  
It is possible, however, to navigate through the document with the cursor in order to read them.  
They automatically include all subdocuments.  
If you change one or more subdocuments after creating an index, you should update the indexes in the master document.  
To do this, click the icon Update on the Navigator for master documents and select the entries to be updated from the submenu.  
References work between Master Document and subdocuments, as well as within subdocuments, when these are definite in all documents involved.  
Therefore, if the figures in a subdocument are numbered from "figure 1" to "figure 10", the figures in the next subdocument can start with "figure 11).  
If you want, you can save the master document together with all its parts as a combined %PRODUCTNAME Writer document.  
To do this, choose the command File - Save as and choose a "normal" %PRODUCTNAME Writer format in the list box File type.  
When printing the master document, all subdocuments, texts, and indexes will be printed.  
Position the mouse pointer in the Navigator on the corresponding entry.  
The path information of the original document will appear in a small window.  
If the file is no longer found under the original path, the warning File not found is shown in red in addition to the path.  
Remarks Concerning Headers and Footers  
Headers and footers are always linked to the Page Style.  
All pages with the same Page Style automatically have the same headers and footers.  
By using Fields in the headers and footers you can insert variable content in your text documents, such as page numbers and chapter headings.  
If you want to have other differences in the content of headers and footers, it is best to create different Page Styles and apply these to the pages.  
Choose Insert - Header or Insert - Footer to select the Page Style in which you want to insert or remove headers or footers.  
You can also choose Format - Page to start a dialog that allows you to select headers or footers for the current Page Style.  
Here you will find a check box Same content left/right.  
If this is not marked, you can format different headers and footers on the left sides than on the right sides.  
If you only want to assign a single page a different header, you could also insert a text box to cover the header text.  
Anchor the frame to the page, and assign the "Wrap Through" option and the background color "White."  
Remarks concerning headers and footers in HTML format  
Some of the header and footer commands are also available for HTML documents.  
Since these headers and footers are not provided in the HTML definition, they are exported as special tags and are correctly interpreted again upon loading an HTML page with %PRODUCTNAME.  
Web browsers show the content of the header or footer as the text which was there at the time of the HTML export, whereas %PRODUCTNAME inserts a field again and updates this as and when necessary. (However, author and sender are only inserted as a field if you yourself are the author or were the last one to modify the document.) Headers and footers are exported in HTML documents if they are enabled in Online Layout mode.  
Defining Different Headers  
A defined header and footer appear in all pages that have the same Page Style.  
However, you may often need a different header for the first page or for even and odd-numbered pages.  
For example, you may want the name of the chapter to appear on the left (even) pages and the name of the first subchapter to appear on the right (odd) pages.  
Since headers are a property of the Page Styles, you need to define two different Page Styles and apply them to the respective pages.  
There are preset Styles for First page, Left page and Right page, which you can adapt to your specific needs.  
For example, the Page Style for left pages might have different inner and outer margins, and the style for right pages would be a mirror image of those margins.  
If you don't need different headers and footers, simply choose a mirrored page layout (under Page Layout in the tab Page).  
Switching between odd and even Page Styles and between First Page and Left Pages can be done automatically by defining the Next Style.  
If you define the Page Style with Next Style and apply the new Page Style to the first page, then %PRODUCTNAME will automatically apply the correct Page Styles to the continuation pages.  
Open a new text document.  
Click the Page Styles icon in the Stylist.  
Select the Style First Page to use as the basis for your own Page Style.  
Open the context menu and choose New.  
In the Page Styles dialog, go to the tab Organizer.  
Give your Page Style a name, such as "Page1," and define "Left Page" as the Next Style.  
For the "Left Page" define "Right Page" as the Next Style, and for the "Right Page," choose "Left Page."  
Inserting Chapter Information in Headers  
In the document header you can insert fields that contain the file name, date, time, chapter headings, etc.  
1.  
Enter text in a long document and apply the style "Heading 1" to chapter headings.  
2.  
Activate the header for the document (Format - Page - Header or Insert - Header).  
3.  
Click within the header to position your cursor in it.  
4.  
Enter "Chapter:"  
5.  
Choose the command Insert - Fields - Other.  
6.  
In the Fields dialog, select the Document tab, type Chapter, format Chapter name.  
If you want the header to contain paragraphs formatted with Heading 2 instead of Heading 1, enter a 2 under Layer.  
7.  
Click Insert to add the desired information to the header, and then close the dialog box.  
Now every page of your document will automatically display the chapter heading of your choice in the header.  
Other information can be inserted in the same manner.  
You'll find further menu commands under Insert - Fields.  
You can choose from Date, Time, Page Numbers, Page Count, Subject, Title and Author.  
All additional field commands can be selected under Other.  
Inserting Lines Under Headers  
You can adjust the appearance of the header directly in the header itself.  
Additional attributes are available in the Format - Page dialog in the tab Header.  
You can also select the Header tab to define a document header for the first time.  
Mark Header on.  
When you close the dialog by clicking on OK, a header is created which you can then fill out in the document.  
If you click the More button on the Header tab, you can choose additional settings for the border and background of a header.  
Under Line arrangement click between the two lower angle marks at the bottom of the rectangle.  
You can also use this tab page to define the style of the line and the distance between the header text and the line.  
Hidden Text  
Suppose you only want to see and print text if a certain condition is met.  
The condition compares a fixed value with the content of a variable or database field.  
The possible operators are shown in the List of Operators.  
You have the following options:  
Hidden text - Choose Insert - Fields - Other and enter the hidden text (for example parts of a paragraph) on the Functions tab.  
Hidden paragraph - Choose Insert - Fields - Other and enter the hidden paragraph on the Functions tab.  
A blank paragraph can also be hidden, for example if a database field has no content for the current record.  
You can make hidden paragraphs visible on the screen irrespective of the condition, by marking View - Hidden Paragraphs.  
Conditional text - Choose Insert - Fields - Other and enter the conditional text on the Functions tab.  
With conditional text, you can have two alternative texts, of which one will be displayed and printed if the condition is met, and the other if it is not met.  
Hidden section - You can define sections by choosing Insert - Section.  
A section can contain several paragraphs.  
The section can be hidden, depending on a certain condition.  
Writing Non-Printable Text  
If you'd like to have certain text displayed only on your screen but do not want to have it printed, follow the next steps:  
Draw a frame  
Write the text in the frame  
Go to Format - Frame....  
The Frame dialog is displayed.  
In the Options tab, un-mark the Print check box.  
The frame will be displayed only on your screen and will not be printed.  
Insert - Fields - Other  
Insert - Section  
Inserting Hyperlinks in Text Documents From Navigator  
Inserting hyperlinks with the Navigator  
The drag mode Insert as Hyperlink must be switched on.  
You can also use this method to open hyperlinks to objects in other opened documents.  
This is how to do it:  
Open the Navigator  
In the Navigator click on the plus sign next to the figures  
Select the drag mode Insert as Hyperlink (if it is not already selected)  
Drag the entry "Figure 3" into the text document.  
The name of the figure is inserted in the text document as an underlined hyperlink.  
Click on it to jump directly to the figure.  
If "Figure 3", that you want to reference with a hyperlink, is contained in another text document, proceed as follows:  
Open both documents  
In the text document in which you want to insert the hyperlink, open the Navigator  
In the combo box at the bottom of the Navigator, select the other text document containing the figure  
Select the drag mode Insert as Hyperlink  
In the Navigator click on the plus sign next to the illustrations  
Drag the entry "Figure 3" into the text document.  
Importing Lists From Other Text Programs  
Every text program has its own way of internally organizing bulleted lists and numbering.  
If the import filter of %PRODUCTNAME fails to evaluate this information correctly, this is what you should do:  
Import the document from the other application (File - Open and then the Files of type list box).  
If the bullets are not applied correctly, try saving the document in the other application in RTF format and then import it.  
Select the string of characters which now appears at the start of each list and copy to the clipboard.  
This can be, for example, an asterisk * followed by a tab.  
Start the Find & Replace dialog.  
Insert the content of the clipboard in the Search for field.  
You can ensure that the search text is only found at the start of the paragraph by inserting ^ before the search text and marking Regular expressions.  
Click on Find All.  
All imported lists are now selected.  
Do not close the Find & Replace dialog just yet.  
Click on the Bullets on/off icon on the Object Bar.  
All the imported lists now become %PRODUCTNAME lists.  
In the Find & Replace dialog, click on Replace All.  
Since the field is empty, all selected strings consisting of, for example, asterisk * and tab will be deleted.  
In the Numbering/Bullets dialog you can define the type of bullets for your bulleted lists.  
Editing or Deleting Index and Table Entries  
However, the shading will not be printed.  
If you prefer not to display the shaded entries on-screen either, you can switch the highlighting on or off with View - Field Shadings.  
To edit an entry, place the cursor immediately before or inside this entry.  
Then choose Edit - Index Entry.  
You can alter the text in the Entry text box.  
Click on the Delete button to delete this entry from the list.  
If you modified the displayed text of the entry, the altered text will be inserted into the generated index.  
You will now only see a thin gray mark in the document where the entry was.  
If you want to edit an entry such as this, place the cursor directly after the thin mark and choose Edit - Index Entry.  
Use the arrow buttons in the Edit Index Entry dialog to switch to the next or previous entry of the same index type.  
Updating, Editing and Deleting Indexes and Tables of Contents  
Place the cursor in the index/table and call the context menu.  
The context menu contains commands for updating, editing or deleting the current index or table of contents.  
By default they are protected from changes.  
You can only set the cursor in an index or table of contents when under Tools - Options - Text Document - Formating Aids the Cursor in protected areas - Enable check box is marked.  
To now edit the index or table of contents, call from the context menu the command Edit Index/Table.  
In the dialog that appears, go to the Index/Table tab page and unmark the Protected from manual changes check box.  
Defining Index/Table of Contents Entries  
Before creating an index or table of contents, determine which entries in your document you want included.  
For entries in the table of contents, the simplest method is:  
Assign the Paragraph Styles "Heading 1" to "Heading 10" to your headings, according to the hierarchical level.  
The table of contents can then be created automatically. (You can also add paragraphs formatted with other Paragraph Styles to the table of contents, see.)  
First define entries for other indexes as entries in the document.  
Select the word or words in your document which are to be listed in the index.  
Several words can be selected by holding down the Shift key if they are listed one after the other, or by holding down the Command Ctrl key if they are spaced apart.  
When selecting a single word you only need to position the cursor in the word to select - it does not need to be highlighted.  
Enter the selected words in an index by choosing Insert - Indexes - Entries.  
If you want a different term to appear in the index, you enter it in the Entry field.  
For example, you could enter "dictionary, defining", whereas only the word "dictionary" appears in the text.  
You can define all similar words in your text as entries by choosing Insert - Indexes and Tables - Entry and marking Apply to all similar texts.  
If you want to include the words in a separate index with a name of your choice, in the Insert Index Entry dialog, click on the New User-defined Index icon.  
This opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for the index.  
This name later appears as the title of the index.  
You can change the title of an index without the content of the index changing.  
Editing the Format of an Index/Table of Contents  
In the Insert Index dialog, on the Entries tab you can also edit the format of the index.  
Amongst other things, you can alter the way in which entries, tab stops and page numbers are arranged.  
On the Styles tab you can assign other Paragraph Styles.  
For detailed instructions, refer to the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
You can automatically assign hyperlinks to the entries in the table of contents.  
To do this, go to the Entries tab page, place the cursor in the structure row before the entry<E#>, click the Hyperlinkbutton, then place the cursor after <E> and click Hyperlinkagain.  
In the list of contents of your document you can then click a hyperlink to go straight to the first occurrence.  
The table of contents must be generated from headings.  
Creating Alphabetical Indexes  
Place the cursor where you want to create the index.  
Choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Indexes and Tables.  
The Insert Index/Table dialog appears.  
On the Index/Table tab, select "Alphabetical Index" as Type.  
To generate the alphabetical key word index using the default settings, click OK.  
You have the options, of whether letters under which entries exist, are to be highlighted as subtitles ("alphabetical delimiter" in the Entries tab) or if case-sensitivity is to be taken into account when sorting and much more.  
If you want to change the formatting of the individual lines in the index, it is best to edit the Paragraph Styles in the Stylist.  
All direct formatting will be overwritten at the next update.  
Using a Concordance File  
If required, you can add index entries from a concordance file.  
A concordance file contains a number of key words and information as to how these words are to be seen in an index.  
Choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Indexes and Tables.  
On the Index/Table tab page, select the type Alphabetical Index.  
Mark the Concordance file check box.  
Click the File button to select whether to open, create, or edit a concordance file.  
Further information on the structure of the concordance file can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Creating Bibliographies  
A bibliography entry could be shown in the text as follows: "Smith [Smith 1995] has also carried out research on this matter".  
The reader will then know that more detailed information can be found in the bibliography under "Smith 1995", for example, the full name of the author, title of the book, publisher, etc.  
You can decide which details should appear in the bibliography by going to the Insert Index/Table dialog, choosing the Type "Bibliography" and clicking the Entries tab.  
For example, you will use different entries for magazine articles than for entries concerning books.  
For this reason the bibliography database is divided into different types of sources of literature.  
To edit the bibliography database, choose Tools - Bibliography Database.  
You can also generate a new record in the Insert Bibliography Entry (by clicking the New button), but these "ad hoc" records will be saved only in the current document, not in the Bibliography Database, and then only if you actually insert the relevant new entry.  
To insert the bibliography entries into the text, position the cursor in the text where the entry is to appear and then choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Bibliography Entry.  
The following dialog will appear:  
You should first decide if you want to select the entry from the records contained in the bibliography database or from the entries that are contained in the current document (and which can differ from entries of the same name in the bibliography database).  
An entry in the document content can be identical to an entry in the Bibliography Database.  
The entry in the document has precedence.  
If the required entry already exists as a data record select it in the list box Short name and click Insert.  
If the desired entry does not yet exist, create a new entry.  
If you use the New button to do this, you can define a new record, but this will only be recognized in the current document.  
If the record should be included in your bibliography database, choose Tools - Bibliography Database, enter the new record and then insert the bibliography database entry in the document.  
Indexes Covering Multiple Documents  
There are several ways of creating an index covering multiple documents:  
You can create an index in each individual document, then copy the indexes into a document and post-edit them.  
A more elegant solution is to select each individual index as a section (Insert - Section) and insert these sections in a common index document as a link.  
If you are working with a master document, common indexes are possible across all sub-documents.  
Creating a Table of Contents  
Place the cursor where you want to create the table of contents.  
Choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Indexes and Tables.  
The Insert Index/Table dialog appears.  
Click the Index/Table tab and select "Table of Contents" as Type (the first time you start this dialog, this tab page and type are already selected).  
Click on OK if you want to generate the table of contents from the headings and entries you have defined.  
If you want to insert additional paragraphs of another Paragraph Style into the table of contents, mark the Additional Styles check box and click the icon next to the box.  
A dialog will open where you can define which Paragraph Styles are also to appear in the table of contents and on which level they are to be shown.  
If you later want to change the headings, rearrange their sequence or insert new chapters, you will have to update the table of contents:  
Place the cursor in the table of contents.  
Call the context menu and choose Update Index/Table.  
You can also select Tools - Update - All Indexes and Tables to update all the indexes and tables of contents in a document.  
Creating User-Defined Indexes  
You can create as many user-defined indexes as you want.  
Click the icon New User-Defined Index in the dialog Insert Index Entry and enter the name of the new index.  
After this you can carry out the entries for this new index.  
Finally you can create the index in your document:  
Position the cursor on the place where the user-defined index is to be created.  
Choose Insert - Indexes and Tables - Indexes and Tables....  
The dialog Insert Index/Table will appear.  
Select the "user-defined" type on the Index/Table tab page.  
If you have given the user-defined index a name select this name from the Type list box.  
Select the index type in the list box and click OK to generate the index from marked entries.  
Mark Styles and after clicking the... button choose one of the Styles used in the document to generate the index from all those paragraphs having the corresponding Style.  
Mark the other check boxes under Create from if you want to create the index from all the objects of a certain type.  
Enter a fitting title into the Title field for the index (you can alter the title directly in the document but it will be overwritten when the index is updated).  
You can assign names to the objects on the Options tab of the corresponding property dialog.  
Inserting Paragraphs Before Tables at Start of Page  
Suppose you have inserted a table at the very beginning of a text document or immediately after a fixed page break, and now you want to insert text before this table.  
Place the cursor in the first cell of the table, right at the start of any content in that cell.  
Press Enter.  
The table now moves down a line.  
To delete this line before the table, place the cursor in this (empty) line and press Delete.  
Inserting Graphics via Dialog  
Place the cursor at the position in the document where you want to insert the graphic.  
Choose Insert - Graphics - From File.  
You will see a dialog Insert Graphics.  
Select the desired graphic and click on Open.  
By default, the graphic is inserted so that it is centered above the current paragraph.  
Inserting a Chart From %PRODUCTNAME Calc  
Dragging and Dropping a Copy of the Chart  
Open the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document in which the chart is to be inserted.  
Open the %PRODUCTNAME Calc document containing the chart.  
Select the chart with a single click.  
Eight handles will appear around the chart.  
If you accidentally double-click the chart, it will be put in the edit mode, indicated by a gray border.  
To exit the edit mode, single-click outside the chart.  
Drag the chart into the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document.  
If the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document is not visible, you can first arrange the windows appropriately.  
If your operating system or windows manager provides a task bar, you can drag the chart to the %PRODUCTNAME Writer button on the task bar, hold that position for a moment while the %PRODUCTNAME Writer window opens in the foreground and then drop it in the now visible document.  
In the %PRODUCTNAME Writer document, position the chart or modify the scale as you would any object.  
To later modify the chart data, double-click and edit it.  
Charts with Linked Data  
If the data in the %PRODUCTNAME Calc document changes, the chart inserted by this method will not automatically be updated.  
To always have the data up-to-date, you can do as follows:  
In the Calc document, copy the cell range from which the chart is created.  
Go to the Writer document, long-click the Insert icon to open the submenu, then select DDE Link.  
The data is now in a table in the Writer document and is always linked via DDE to the source data in the Calc document.  
Position the cursor in the table.  
Long-click the Insert Objects icon on the main toolbar to open the floating toolbar where you then click the Insert Chart icon.  
Inserting Graphics From %PRODUCTNAME Draw or Impress  
You can copy a graphic object from one document to another by drag and drop.  
If you plan to publish your document, please observe copyright laws and be sure to obtain the consent of the authors of the original page.  
Open the document in which you want to insert the graphic object.  
Open the document from which you want to copy the graphic object.  
This selects the object without activating a hyperlink that may be connected to it.  
Keep the mouse button pressed and wait a moment while the object is copied to the clipboard.  
Drag the graphic object into the other document.  
If the documents are not visible side by side, first move the mouse pointer to the button of the target document.  
Keep the mouse button pressed!  
The document in question is then displayed and you can move the mouse pointer into the document.  
Release the mouse button as soon as the gray text cursor indicates the position where you want to insert a copy of the graphic object.  
If the object is connected to a hyperlink, the hyperlink will be inserted instead of the graphic object.  
Inserting Graphics via Drag and Drop From the Gallery  
Drag and drop a graphic object from the gallery into a text document, spreadsheet or presentation to insert the graphic object.  
When you release a graphic object directly on a drawing object, the following rules apply:  
When dragging without pressing a key (i.e. you do not see another sign next to the mouse pointer) only the drawing attributes are transferred from the Gallery and applied to the drawing object over which you release the mouse button.  
When dragging while pressing the Ctrl key(i.e. you see a plus sign next to the mouse pointer) the graphic object is inserted as an object.  
When dragging while pressing the Shift and Ctrl keys (i.e. you see a linking arrow next to the mouse pointer) the drawing object will be replaced by the object from the Gallery.  
The position and size of the object that was replaced will remain valid for the new graphic.  
Inserting Graphics With a Scanner  
To carry out scanning in %PRODUCTNAME, you must have installed a scanner with appropriate driver software on your system.  
Under Windows, %PRODUCTNAME supports the TWAIN standard.  
Under Unix, %PRODUCTNAME supports the SANE standard.  
Place the cursor at the position in the document where you want to insert the graphic.  
Choose Insert - Graphics - Scan.  
The submenu contains a command to open a dialog for selecting the scanning source.  
From the submenu, select the command to request scanning.  
The scanner driver opens a window in which you should follow the scanner manufacturer's instructions.  
Once the scanning process is completed, the image is inserted in your %PRODUCTNAME document.  
Inserting Graphics  
There are several ways of inserting a graphic object in a text document.  
Inserting Decorative Horizontal Lines  
Choose Insert - Horizontal Line to open a dialog for selecting decorative lines.  
The lines are graphics anchored to the current paragraph and centered between the margins.  
You can also find these lines in a Gallery theme.  
If you want to continue using a line from the Internet, add it to the relevant theme in the Gallery.  
The line can then be selected from this dialog.  
Gallery  
Changing Numbering via the Keyboard  
If you want to move your numbering down a level in the hierarchy (or further to the right), place the cursor at the beginning of the numbered paragraph and press the Tab key.  
Press Shift and Tab together to move an indented bulleted or numbered list up one level (to the left).  
If you want to insert a tab stop at the beginning of a numbered line, press (Command) (Ctrl) (Tab).  
Combining Two Separate Numbered Lists  
To combine two separate numbered lists into one continuous numbered list, select both numbered lists and double-click on the Numbering on/off icon on the Object Bar.  
Example  
Then you change item 3 to an unnumbered paragraph.  
The numbering now looks like this:  
1.  
First line  
2.  
Second line  
Third line  
1.  
Fourth line  
2.  
Fifth line  
If you delete the third line altogether, the numbering will not automatically run continuously from 1 to 4.  
Select the lines numbered 1., 2., 1., 2. and then double click on the Numbering on/off icon on the Object Bar.  
Positioning Cursor at Bookmarks  
If bookmarks are set in a text document, hold down Ctrl and click right-click in the Page field on the Status Bar to get a context menu showing the available bookmarks.  
Click on one of the bookmarks in the context menu to move the cursor to that point.

The tip of the object should be pointed upwards.  
With the object still selected, choose the Format - Line command.  
In the dialog, click the Arrow Styles tab.  
Click Add and assign a name to the new arrow style.  
The line end is automatically saved.  
Drawing Lines in Text  
You can incorporate lines in your text, the angle, width, color, etc. of which can be defined however you'd like.  
Create a horizontal line suitable, for example, for a website, by applying the preset Paragraph Style Horizontal Line.  
Place the cursor on a blank line and double-click the Horizontal Line Style in the Stylist.  
If the entry for horizontal lines is not visible in the list of Paragraph Styles, switch the view in the Stylist from "Automatic" to "All Styles".  
You can draw a line above, beside or below a paragraph by choosing Format - Paragraph - Borders.  
This function is explained in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
To define the line attributes and direction yourself, use the Line drawing object as follows:  
1.

Open the Format - Line dialog.  
Click on the Line Styles tab.  
Here you define a line style.  
As you can see, there are many different ways of combining dashes and dots and spacing.  
Dots are always as long as they are wide, but you are free to set the length of dashes and distances.  
Mark Fit to line width to set the length as a percentage of the line width.  
Define a new line style and click on Add.  
Give a name to the new style.  
The new style is saved automatically.  
You can also save the line style in your own line style list.  
When you open the Save dialog with the Save Line Styles icon, all existing line styles will be saved as a file under the name you specify.  
Applying Line Styles

In the dialog, click the From File button to start a dialog in which you can make a selection like under File - New - Templates and Documents.  
Creating Form Letters  
To aid you in creating form letters, the following section first gives you brief instructions and then detailed instructions.  
Brief Instructions (For Quick Results)  
Register an address data source in %PRODUCTNAME, if you have not done so already.  
You can find instructions under the search term "address book" in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Press Shift+Ctrl+N to open one of the form letter templates provided.  
In the Business Correspondence category, select the Elegant Letter, for example.  
Select the addresses to be used for the form letter, or enter them now.  
Let %PRODUCTNAME create the form letter and print it.  
Detailed Instructions (With Background Information)  
To create a form letter you need the recipients' addresses, which should be in the form of a StarBase database table, and a text document containing the text of the letter.  
You will notice that fields appear at the positions in the text where the name and address should be printed.  
These fields draw their information from the corresponding database fields.  
You can define these fields if you go to the Insert menu and choose Field and from the sub menu select Other.  
The Fields dialog will appear, where you can define the fields.  
Fields are a type of place holder in your document.  
These can be chosen when first inserting a field or opening or printing a current document.  
You can carry out an update manually with the (F9) key.  
Fixed and Variable Fields  
"Fixed" fields are fields which are filled out only once, i.e., when the field is inserted into the document.  
For example, if you write an invoice based on an invoice template you can use a "fixed" date.  
The minute you set up the invoice document, you will see in the field position the actual date which will not change later on.  
That is, the date of the invoice is determined only once.  
On the other hand, a "variable" date is updated every time you open and print the document.  
A manual update of the fields (i.e. with the F9 key) sets the actual date in the field entered as "Variable date"  
If, for example, you want to insert a date as a field in your form letter, you have to decide if it is to be inserted as a fixed or as variable date:  
Choose to use a fixed date if the date should never change, i.e., as if you could have typed in the date directly (without a field).  
What is then the advantage of using a field?  
You can save the form letter as a template, and if you later want to write a new form letter based on that template, the date will automatically be updated.  
If you choose the variable date, the date will be updated every time you open or print the document.  
Apart from the date there are various other fields which you can also use in your form letter.  
The most important fields are the ones which determine where the different elements of the recipient's address are to be placed.  
These fields have a direct connection to the database table which contains your address list.  
A field will be inserted in the form letter for each data field (i.e. name, street, city, etc.).  
When printing, %PRODUCTNAME Writer inserts the desired data fields in the fields for each record.  
If you want to create a completely new document containing the necessary form letter fields, you can use drag and drop to do so:  
Open the text document and press F4 to show the desired database table.  
Point to a column header and, holding down the mouse button, drag it into the document.  
The field for inserting this item from this database table is automatically placed in the document.  
Choose File - New - Templates and Documents to open a document based on the Elegant Letter template from the Business Correspondence category.  
A form letter based on the "Elegant Letter" template will be displayed.  
It already contains fields for the address, date, sender, etc.  
In the Use of this Template dialog that automatically appears, select the option Several recipients (address database).  
Since the "Elegant Letter" template is linked to an address database, the address table is opened automatically in the data source view.  
If this does not happen, press F4 to open the data source for the current document.  
Select the records you want to use in the form letter by clicking the row headers at the left in the data source view.  
Press the Shift key and/or the Command Ctrl key to make your selection.  
To print a form letter for all the records in the table, click the empty field above the row headers to select all records.  
Now click the Form Letter icon on the database bar at the top of the data source view.  
The Form Letter dialog appears, where you can choose what you want to send as e-mail or print.  
You can also choose if you want to print selected records, all records or a particular range.  
If you want to print a range, e.g., records 1 to 5, make sure that the numbers follow the order displayed in the data source view.  
You can sort or filter records in the data source view by clicking the respective icons on the database bar.  
For example, to sort all records according to ZIP (postal) code, place the cursor in the ZIP CODE field of any record and click Sort Ascending.  
Now your form letter is all ready to go!  
Avoiding Blank Paragraphs  
If you have chosen the form letter field COMPANY to appear in the recipient field, a blank line might appear in your printed letter.  
That happens if the COMPANY database field in the database is empty.  
However, it is possible to prevent empty fields from being included.  
Place the cursor in your text document before the form letter field COMPANY.  
Choose Insert - Fields - Other to open the Fields dialog.  
On the Functions tab select the type Hidden Paragraph.  
Now, in the Condition field, enter the following text (without quotation marks):  
not(Company)  
If the COMPANY database field is now empty, the COMPANY line will not be printed, and the rest of the lines will be moved upward.

Turning off Number Recognition in Tables  
When you enter a number in a text table, %PRODUCTNAME Writer can automatically convert the number into a date.  
The date format, which is defined in your operating system, specifies which character leads to an automatic replacement and how this is formatted.  
In the USA, the forward slash is a date separator.  
With %PRODUCTNAME Writer running on an American operating system, if you enter the number 2/28, this will automatically be converted to the date 2/28/01 (in the year 2001).  
In Germany the period is a date separator.  
With %PRODUCTNAME Writer running on a German operating system, if you enter the number 28.2, this will automatically be converted to the date 28.02.01 (in the year 2001).  
You may or may not want it to do this.  
You can turn the replacement function on and off as follows:  
Place the cursor in a text table.  
Then click on Number recognition.  
If there is a tick before the command, the number recognition and hence the automatic replacement functions are turned on.  
Alternatively:  
Choose Tools - Options.  
Click on Text Document - Table.  
Mark the check boxes Number recognition and Number format recognition to turn on the automatic replacement function.  
Tools - Options - Text Document - Table  
Numbering Lines  
Select line numbering properties under Tools - Line Numbering.  
Use line numbering to number the lines within your document.  
You can decide, for the whole of the document, whether blank lines should be counted as well, and whether lines in text frames should likewise be counted.  
You can decide the intervals at which lines are numbered and insert separators between these intervals to identify a particular line number.  
The line numbering appears on your screen and is printed.  
You can apply other line numbering properties to the paragraph (Format - Paragraph - Numbering) or to the Paragraph Style.  
Doing it this way ensures greater flexibility, as you can exclude a paragraph from the line numbering or restart the numbering at a paragraph with any starting value.  
Line Numbering for All Paragraphs  
Choose Tools - Line Numbering.  
Mark the Show Numbering check box.  
Now all the paragraphs in the document will be numbered.  
Line Numbering for Particular Paragraphs  
Enable the line numbering for all paragraphs as described above.  
Open the Stylist and click the Default Paragraph Style.  
Right-click to open the context menu where you then choose Modify.  
The Paragraph Style: Default  
Go to the Numbering tab page.  
Remove the mark in front of Include this paragraph in line numbering.  
As all Paragraph Styles are derived from the Default Style, no paragraph will be numbered unless a subordinate Paragraph Style was modified accordingly.  
In the document, select all the paragraphs that are to be numbered.  
Choose Format - Paragraph - Numbering, mark the Include this paragraph in line numbering check box and click OK.  
Tools - Line Numbering  
Interrupting and Continuing Numbering  
In a series of automatically numbered paragraphs, we want one paragraph not to have a number, as in the following example:  
1.  
First paragraph.  
2.  
Paragraph two.  
An unnumbered paragraph.  
3.  
Paragraph number three.  
You can choose from the following methods:  
Delete the automatic numbering  
Select all paragraphs 1 to 4 and click on the Numbering on/off icon.  
Place the cursor before the first character of the third paragraph.  
Press the Backspace key to delete one character to the left.  
The paragraph remains indented but loses its number.  
The fourth character now has the number 3.  
This method also produces the desired result after saving in HTML format.  
Formatting the paragraph  
Select all paragraphs 1 to 4 and click on the Numbering on/off icon.  
Place the cursor in the third paragraph.  
Click again on the Numbering on/off icon.  
The third paragraph loses its number and its indentation.  
In HTML format, the interruption creates two separately numbered lists.  
Continuing numbering with a new starting value  
Number paragraphs 1 and 2 with the Numbering on/off icon.  
Place the cursor in the fourth paragraph.  
Choose Format - Numbering/Bullets and go to the Options tab.  
In the Numbering combo box select "1, 2, 3...".  
In the Start at spin box select the starting value - in this case 3.  
Click OK.  
Defining Number Ranges  
To number all the elements in your document that belong together, for example all the notes, warning messages, quotations, etc., you can define a separate number range, or sequence, for each group.  
Example  
For example, type "Quote Number" in front of the first quote.  
Choose Insert - Fields - Other....  
On the Variables tab page, select the "Number Range" field.  
For the Name, enter "Quote."  
Click Insert and close the dialog.  
The "Quote" number range enables you to automatically number all the quotes in your document.  
In the field Value, you can select a new initial value for the entire number range.  
This is useful when you are dealing with a document in a series of connected documents.  
Number ranges and captions can be restarted at each chapter.  
In the Caption and Fields dialogs you can choose the chapter level at which to begin renumbering.  
Inserting and Deleting Page Breaks  
Inserting page breaks  
Place the cursor at the point where you want a new page to begin.  
Press (Ctrl)(Enter).  
A fixed page break is inserted, and the cursor is now at the beginning of the new page.  
Deleting page breaks  
Place the cursor before the first character of the first paragraph after the fixed page break.  
Press Backspace.  
The fixed page break is deleted.  
Deleting a page break before a text table  
Place the cursor in the table and open the context menu.  
Select Table This opens the Table dialog.  
Click the Text Flow tab.  
Unmark Break.  
Insert Break dialog  
Page Styles and Page Numbers  
You want to create a text document without a page number on the title page, with lowercase or uppercase roman numerals on the pages of the table of contents (you do not know how many yet), and then you want to start the page numbering with arabic numerals.  
Different Page Styles are the %PRODUCTNAME Writer equivalent of "section changes" in other text programs.  
It is best to have page numbers in footers or headers rather than in the running text, to make sure that the page numbers do not change their position when text is inserted or deleted.  
You can do this for example by following these steps:  
Create new Page Styles  
Apply Page Styles  
Edit Page Styles  
If you want, you can format the page numbers in the Paragraph Style of the footer.  
The offset is only used, for example, at the end of a page to display the number of the next page, i.e. to offset the display; it does not change the page number itself.  
This property is set as direct formatting in the first paragraph of that page.  
Create Page Styles  
1.  
You can also begin with a new text document, although you need to first enter some text and page breaks to be able to follow the steps described here.  
2.  
Open the Stylist.  
3.  
Select the Page Styles view in the Stylist.  
4.  
Call up the context menu of one of the Page Styles and select the New... command.  
You will see the Page Style dialog with the Organizer tab page.  
The cursor will be blinking in the Name text box where you can directly enter the name of the first new Page Style.  
5.  
You can change the properties of the new Page Styles later.  
6.  
In the context menu of the Stylist click the New... command again and define the Page Style with the name "Table of contents".  
7.  
In a real situation you would naturally enter the names of your choice.  
You have now created the three new Styles.  
Applying Page Styles  
1.  
Place the cursor on the first page of your document.  
Double-click the Title page entry in the Stylist.  
To confirm this, you will see the name Title page in the Page Style field on the status bar below.  
By the way, you can also edit (double-click) and assign existing Page Styles via the context menu of the Page Style field on the status bar.  
If all the pages had been defined by the Standard Page Style, they are now all defined by the new Style.  
In the example described here, for the Page Style Title page you can select the Next Style Table of Contents.  
Please note that you should always choose the Table of Contents Page Style as the Next Style to follow the Table of Contents, since you cannot be sure how many pages long your Table of Contents will be.  
2.  
Now place the cursor at the beginning of the page where the Table of Contents should begin.  
Go ahead and enter a manual page break with a change of Page Styles.  
3.  
Choose Insert - Manual Break.  
The Insert Break dialog appears.  
4.  
In the list box select the Table of Contents Page Style which will then begin at this point in your document.  
5.  
Place the cursor at the beginning of the first line in your main text.  
6.  
Choose Insert - Manual Break.  
The Insert Break dialog appears.  
7.  
In the combo box, select the Main text Page Style, which should be applied after this point.  
Now click OK.  
If you want headers or footers to contain different contents on the right and left sides, you just have to unmark the Same content left/right check box.  
This lets you define an inner and an outer margin for the text.  
You can assign these Styles to the corresponding pages in the Stylist context menu with the Modify command.  
Editing Page Styles  
Follow these instructions:  
Select the Main Text entry in the Stylist, open the context menu of that entry and choose Modify.  
You see the Page Style: Main Text  
Go to the Footer tab.  
Mark the Activate Footer check box.  
Click OK.  
Use the mouse cursor to select it.  
To have "Page" precede the page number, place the cursor in front of the field and enter "Page".  
Click the Center icon on the object bar to center the current paragraph.  
Page Breaks as Paragraph Formats  
To check this for the first paragraph after the manual break, choose Paragraph... from the context menu (not Edit Paragraph Style, since this is a direct formatting attribute for a paragraph).  
If you want a particular paragraph to be on a new page with a new Page Style, then that would be a property of that particular paragraph.  
Assign this property under Format - Paragraph - Text Flow.  
Changing the Format of Page Numbers  
The direct format, however, should only be used in a few instances.  
When direct formatting, you edit the the field directly as follows:  
1.  
Double-click the field with the page number.  
You will now see the Edit Fields: Document  
2.  
Select the field format.  
Now click OK.  
Normally, you would determine the page number format as a property of the Page Style:  
Then you will see, for example, the Page Style: Default  
Instead of "Default", the title bar of the dialog contains the name of the current Page Style.  
Go to the Page tab.  
Then close the dialog with OK.  
Now select the As Page Style format for the field which shows the page number (see the description of direct formats above).  
If you want to change other properties in the footer, e.g. the font, you need to edit the Footer Paragraph Style so that the changes will apply to all footers.  
Place the cursor in the footer.  
Call the context menu and choose Edit Paragraph Style.  
If you want to increase the spacing of the footer from the text above, this is a format attribute of the Page Style:  
Change the Page Style in the Stylist with the Modify... command in the the context menu.  
In the Page Style dialog you can determine the width and height of the footer.  
Text Flow  
Creating Landscape Page Formats  
Open the Stylist, with (F11) for example.  
Click on the Page Styles icon to change to the Page Styles view.  
The current Page Style is selected.  
Click on the New Style from Selection icon.  
This opens the Create Style dialog.  
Give the style a name.  
Select the name Landscape for example, and click OK.  
In the Stylist, single-click the new Landscape Style.  
Then open the context menu and choose Modify.  
This opens the Page Style: Landscape  
Make the necessary changes to this style as compared with the current style.  
In this example you should go to the Page tab, under Paper format select Landscape orientation, and click OK.  
Now you have a new Page Style in landscape format, which you can apply to selected pages.  
Changing Portrait/Landscape Page Formats  
Suppose you have a 10-page document in portrait (vertical) format, in Default page format.  
You need page 5 to be in landscape (horizontal) format, to accommodate a table better.  
Create a Page Style in landscape format.  
Give it the name Landscape, for example.  
Place the cursor immediately before the text that you want printed in landscape format.  
Choose Insert - Manual Break.  
This opens the Insert Break dialog.  
Select Page break.  
In the combo box select the Page Style Landscape.  
Click OK.  
Now, pages 1 to 4 are in default format, and pages 5 to the end of the document are in landscape format.  
So place the cursor at the end of page 5 and insert another manual break there:  
At the end of the page in landscape format, choose Insert - Manual Break.  
Select Page break.  
In the combo box select the Page Style Default.  
Click OK.  
You can check the results in the Preview: choose File - Page Preview.  
Quick Formatting Using the Adjacent Paragraph Format  
This is the quickest method:  
Delete the paragraph mark (nonprinting character) between two paragraphs.  
Press Enter.  
Both paragraphs now have the same format with the same Style.  
When you delete by going to the end of the first paragraph and pressing the Delete (Del) key, the second paragraph will be brought into the first (known as "deleting to the right").  
If you then turn the text back into two paragraphs by pressing the Enter key twice, the second paragraph assumes the format of the first.  
If you delete by going to the beginning of the second paragraph and pressing Backspace (above the Enter key), the second paragraph stays the same (known as "deleting to the left").  
Then press Enter to get two paragraphs with the format of the second paragraph.  
Selecting printer paper trays  
This is how you can call different paper trays for your letters.  
Let's say you want to print the first page using company letterhead paper from the default paper tray.  
But you want to print the second page on blank paper from paper tray 2.  
Assign a page template to the first page (under Stylist), for which you define a Next Style (on the Organizer tab).  
The Next Style is a Page Style that you define in which you specify in the properties, on the Page tab, that the paper from paper tray 2 is to be used.  
If the text exceeds one page, %PRODUCTNAME automatically uses the Page Style defined as the Next Style for the subsequent pages.  
During printing, paper will be automatically drawn from the correct paper trays.  
Printing HTML Documents Without Headers  
This is how you can print HTML documents without headers/footers.  
Document templates are used to format HTML pages.  
If you don't want to print headers or footers when printing HTML pages, the appropriate template must be changed.  
Its title is Standard Template For HTML Documents (html.stw).  
Create a backup copy of the file.  
Open the template by going to the Open dialog and selecting the file type "%PRODUCTNAME %PRODUCTVERSION Text Document Template".  
To remove the Headers/Footers, choose Format - Page - Header and unmark Header on.  
A %PRODUCTNAME warning will appear because you are about to discard the contents of the header.  
Since this is exactly what you want to do, confirm the message.  
Finally, click OK to close the Page Format dialog.  
You will be asked if you want to save your changes.  
From now on, HTML pages will be printed without headers or footers.  
Displaying Print Previews  
Before printing out a document, you can obtain a preview of how the printed document will look, so you can adjust margin widths, optimize page breaks etc.  
1.  
Switch to the document you want to preview.  
2.  
Choose File - Page Preview.  
3.  
Use the icons on the object bar to zoom in or out.  
4.  
Use the arrow keys or object bar icons to scroll through the pages of the document and check how they will appear in print.  
File - Page Preview.  
Reduced Printing of Documents  
If you would like a reduced printout of your text document so as to save paper, choose File - Page Preview.  
Here you can decide whether to have two, four or any number of pages beside and on top of each other.  
To print two pages beside one another on one sheet of paper  
1.  
Choose File - Page Preview.  
2.  
You will see the Page Preview with two pages alongside each other.  
If you see more or fewer pages, click the icon Page Preview: Two Pages

Click on the Print page view icon.  
Click OK to confirm.  
4.  
Clicking the Print options page view icon starts a dialog where you can enter settings for reduced printing.  
File - Page Preview  
Setting References  
In contrast to hyperlinks, references allow you to move within a document, but not among multiple documents.  
References are inserted as field commands.  
You first must define a reference target for the cross-reference.  
You can also set cross-references to the captions of charts and tables.  
Step-by-step instructions are given below.  
Place the cursor at the point you want to refer to.  
Select a word as a destination for the reference.  
This will enable you to find the position in the document more easily later on.  
Choose Insert - Cross-reference.  
Select "Set reference" and under Name enter a unique name for the reference.  
Click on Insert.  
Now go to the location where you want the cross-reference to appear and insert another field command.  
Your text here might read: "For further information see page".  
Choose Insert - Cross-reference.  
Select the field type "Insert reference." Under Select, you will find the names of all references defined in the document.  
Select the desired reference, choose a Format option and click Insert.  
Select the picture or table, choose the menu command Insert - Caption and click OK.  
Place your cursor at the position where you want the reference to appear.  
Choose Insert - Cross-reference.  
On the References tabpage, select one of the elements under Type for which you have defined a caption.  
Then, under Select, choose the illustration to which the reference should refer.  
In the Format list box, select the type of reference.  
Finally, click Insert.  
The Format "Above/Below" for example adds the words "above" or "below", regardless of whether the figure in the document is above or below the reference.  
The format "Chapter" sets an outline numbering and a suitably formatted heading above the figure.  
The format "As Page Style" sets a page indication in the format entered under Format - Page- Page tab under Numbering.  
References are not supported for documents exported in HTML format.  
Resetting Font Attributes While Typing  
You may want to apply direct formatting while you are typing text.  
After that you may want to reset all formatting and continue entering text in the default format.  
Enter the text using direct character formatting, then press the right arrow key once to revert to the default Paragraph Style.  
Now, continue entering text at the end of the current paragraph.  
Example  
Type "This is written in", then click on the Bold and Italic icons on the Object Bar.  
Then, instead of clicking on the two icons again, simply press the right arrow key once.  
Then carry on typing in the default format of the paragraph you are in.  
Docking, Enlarging and Reducing Windows  
A window such as the Navigator or Stylist can be docked or viewed as a variable-size window.  
Hold down (Command) (Ctrl) and double-click on a gray area in the Navigator window.  
The docked Navigator becomes a variable-size window, whose size you can vary by dragging the borders.  
After you have finished working in the Navigator, again hold down (Command) (Ctrl) and double-click on a gray area, and it will return to the docked position.  
You can do the same with other windows, such as the Stylist or Gallery.  
Searching for Text With Wildcards  
Call the Find & Replace dialog, using Command Ctrl +F.  
Mark the Regular expressions check box.  
Enter the search term with the desired wildcards and click Find.  
Regular expressions are shown in a form that should be familiar to Unix command line users.  
The wildcard for any number of a given character is the character itself followed by an asterisk.  
For example:  
If you enter "Hawai*" as the search word, this means than any number of "i's" may occur after "Hawa", but do not have to.  
The words "Hawa", "Hawai" and "Hawaii" will be found.  
The wildcard for a single character is the period.  
This is equivalent to the wildcard? in file names.  
The wildcard for several characters in succession is .* (period and asterisk).  
This is equivalent to the wildcard * in file names.  
A paragraph end can be found with the dollar sign ($), and the first character at the beginning of a paragraph with the string ^. (caret and period).  
You can only search for regular expressions within paragraphs.  
There are many other wildcards that you can use listed in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
List of Wildcards  
Editing Sections  
You can edit the sections in your text document by choosing Format - Sections.  
This dialog allows you to protect sections, unprotect sections, reveal hidden sections, change the conditions and remove sections, i.e. turn them back into normal text.  
Inserting Sections  
Place the cursor at the point where you want to insert a new section, or select the text that is to form a new section.  
Choose Insert - Section.  
You can define other settings for the section in the dialog.  
Click Insert.  
You can insert other documents or sections from other documents.  
You can enter a file name in the text box, or click "..." to search for a file.  
You can select a named section of the document in the Section combo box.  
When you open a document that contains linked sections, you will be asked whether you want to update these sections.  
If you answer yes, the current versions of the linked sections will be updated.  
Under Windows you can also use the DDE method to keep inserted sections up to date with the current status of the original files.  
You can also have sections as files in HTML documents.  
The inserted sections are automatically updated when %PRODUCTNAME loads the relevant HTML document again.  
Web browsers show the content of the sections as at the time the content was saved as an HTML document.  
> Using Sections  
The sections in text documents mark off blocks of text for special purposes.  
Thus there are the following areas:  
Sections of text with a different number of columns than the master text  
Sections that are protected from further editing  
Sections that are only to be shown under certain circumstances or not shown at all  
Sections that are to be inserted into a document as files or parts of files  
Sections that can be incorporated into other text documents via DDE  
A section always consists of at least one paragraph.  
When you select a text and define it as a section, it is automatically ended with a paragraph break.  
A section from another text document can also be inserted as a section.  
Sections within a single document can also be linked to other locations.  
To insert a new paragraph immediately before or after a section, place the cursor at the very beginning or end of the section and press Option Alt +Enter.  
Sections and Columns  
Multicolumn section:  
A section can contain other sections.  
This feature allows you, for example, to create a two-column section on a page of text, and then create a three-column section within that section.  
Multicolumn page:  
The page format (Format - Page - Columns), which always applies to all pages with the current Page Style, is independent of the sections.  
Multicolumn frame:  
You can also insert frames containing columns of text which you can move freely around the page (from main toolbar, long-click to open Insert floating toolbar, click Insert frame icon).  
For these frames, for example, you can select that the text in the frame be positioned a certain distance from the edge of the frame (Choose Format - Frame - Wrap).  
language recognition  
If you have installed the spellcheck in multiple languages, %PRODUCTNAME can recognize words from other languages and assign them to those languages.  
You must make sure that the option Check in all languages under Tools - Options - Language Settings - Writing Aids is not marked. %PRODUCTNAME then checks only in the language applied to the text as a font attribute.  
With automatic spellcheck enabled, foreign-language words are now indicated by a wavy red underscore.  
In the context menu of such a word, provided the word is written correctly in the language concerned, you will find suggestions for assigning this word or the whole paragraph to one of the other installed languages.  
If the option Check in all languages in the Writing Aids dialog is marked, or if you have applied the relevant language to the foreign-language text as a font attribute, %PRODUCTNAME checks the spelling in the relevant language as well.  
Publishing Text Documents in HTML  
Just like %PRODUCTNAME Calc and %PRODUCTNAME Impress$, [officename] Writer can automatically save a structured document as a web document in HTML format.  
In %PRODUCTNAME Writer, choose which paragraphs should become hyperlinks, at which the document will be split into sub-documents.  
Graphics embedded in the document are automatically saved as JPEG files, in the same folder as the HTML document, and referenced as IMG tags.  
Linked graphics should be located in the same directory as the HTML document, so that they can be referenced with a relative link.  
Type a multi-page text document.  
Apply the style Heading 2, for example, to the headings of the individual sections of the document.  
Choose File - Send - Create HTML Document.  
This opens the dialog Name and Path of the HTML Document.  
At the bottom of the dialog you can see which Paragraph Style serves as the "separator".  
If you would like a different Paragraph Style as "separator", select it in the Current Style combo box.  
In this example you should select Heading 2.  
All paragraphs to which you apply this style become hyperlinks in the HTML document, each of which opens an HTML page with the content appearing below them.  
Enter a path and name for the HTML document you are creating and click Save.  
The HTML document is opened automatically and, like all HTML documents, is read-only.  
To edit it, click on the Edit file icon on the function bar.  
Formatting Text While Typing Using Shortcut Keys  
Bolding text while typing  
Suppose you want to type "Text in bold font":  
Type the words "Text in", not forgetting the space after the words.  
Now press (Command) (Ctrl) (B).  
(Command) (Ctrl) (F) is the keyboard shortcut for bolding text.  
Type the word "bold".  
Press the keyboard shortcut again.  
If you are at the end of a paragraph, there is an even easier way:  
Press the right arrow key once.  
Now carry on typing.

Controlling the Spellcheck via Dialog  
If you choose Tools - Spellcheck - Check or press F7, but there are no unknown words in your document, you will not see the dialog.  
In this case, you need to enter a deliberately misspelled or unknown word.  
You will see the Spellcheck dialog when you call the spellchecker manually via the menu or by pressing F7.  
This method has the advantage that, before calling the dialog, you can select text and then check the spelling only in the text you have selected.  
The Spellcheck dialog is described in detail in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
A manually initiated spellcheck always begins at the cursor position, unless the text was selected (in which case it begins at the beginning of the selected text and ends at its end).  
If the spellcheck does not begin at the beginning of the document, and if the end of the document is reached during the checking process, a dialog appears asking whether you want to continue checking at the beginning of the document.  
The system always searches first through the selected user-defined dictionaries.  
If the word is not found there, it searches through the main dictionary.  
If the word is not there either, you will see the dialog illustrated, which allows you to replace the word.  
Type it correctly in the Word field or select a word from the list of Suggestions, and click on Replace.  
First, select the Dictionary combo box.  
When you replace the word in the Word field with another word, you can check this other word by clicking on the Check Word button.  
If you want, you can automatically enter all unknown words in a text in the active user-defined dictionary.  
For instructions, refer to %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Turning off Bullets or Numbering  
%PRODUCTNAME automatically carries on bulleting when you press Enter.  
Press Enter again to delete the bullet symbol and end bulleting.  
You can stop numbering in the same way.  
If you want to interrupt the numbering of several consecutive paragraphs by inserting an unnumbered paragraph, delete the number before the paragraph with the Delete key.  
The subsequent numbers are modified automatically.  
Transferring Formats With Fill Format Mode  
Applying a new Style in Fill Format Mode:  
Open the Stylist.  
In the Stylist, select the Style you want to copy.  
Click the Fill Format Mode icon.  
Position the watering can on the object to apply the Style currently selected and press the mouse button.  
There is an exception to this procedure: when applying a Character Style in the Fill Format Mode, select the character with the mouse (watering can) while holding down the mouse button instead of only clicking.  
To quit the fill format mode, click the icon again or press Esc.  
Stylist  
Creating New Styles From Selections  
You can create a new Style by copying an existing Style, as follows:  
Open the Stylist.  
In the document, select a formatted text or paragraph the format of which you want to adopt as a Style.  
In the Stylist, click the icon:  
New Style from Selection  
A new Style from Selection can also be made by using drag and drop:  
Choose the type of Style to be used (Paragraph Style, Character Style, etc.) by clicking the corresponding icon at the top of the Stylist.  
Select that part of the paragraph, text or object which is to form the basis of the new Style.  
Drag this to the main Stylist area and release the mouse button over a free area when the insertion line is no longer visible.  
Stylist  
Updating Styles From Selections  
This is how to update a Style:  
Open the Stylist.  
In the document, select a formatted text or paragraph the format of which you want to adopt as a Style.  
In the Stylist, select the Style you want to update (single-click, do not double-click!)  
In the Stylist, click on the icon:  
Update Style  
You can also update the Style by using drag and drop:  
Select the Style to be updated in the Stylist.  
Select the section of paragraph text, the format of which is to be used to update the Style selected in the Stylist.  
Drag the text into the main Stylist area and release the mouse button when you see the insertion line above an entry.  
The Paragraph Style directly above the insertion line is assigned the new format.  
Stylist  
Making Text Superscript and Subscript  
You have the following options for superscripting or subscripting text:  
Use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+P and Ctrl+Shift+B.  
Choose Format - Character - Position.  
Use the icons:  
Open the context menu of the text object bar, choose Visible Buttons and on the submenu mark Subscript and Superscript.  
You will now see the icons on the text object bar.  
Making text superscript/subscript while typing  
Suppose you want to type 1 m² (superscript 2):  
Type 1 m2.  
After the 2, press the space bar or another key defining the end of a word.  
m2 automatically becomes m², if this replacement pair is entered under Tools - AutoCorrect/AutoFormat on the Replace tab.  
You can add other items to the list.  
After the automatic replacement, carry on typing as normal.  
Suppose you want to type H2O with a subscript 2:  
Type the H.  
Press Command Ctrl +Shift+B.  
Command Ctrl +Shift+B is the keyboard shortcut for subscript text, Command Ctrl +Shift+P for superscript text.  
Type the 2.  
Press the keyboard shortcut again.  
If you are at the end of a paragraph, there is an even easier way:  
Press the right arrow key once.  
Type the O.  
Applying subscripts/superscripts retrospectively  
Suppose you want to change H2O to H2O with a subscript 2.  
Either use the key shortcut above or the following method via the menu command:  
Select the character that you want in subscript/superscript.  
In this example you should select the 2.  
Choose Format - Character.  
This opens the Character dialog.  
Click the Position tab.  
Select Subscript and click OK.  
The 2 now appears in subscript.  
Format - Character - Position  
Tools - AutoCorrect/AutoFormat - Replace  
Inserting or Deleting Rows/Columns Using the Keyboard  
This is how to insert and delete rows and columns using the keyboard:  
To insert a new column or row, first of all switch the table to the insert mode for tables by pressing (Option) (Alt) (Ins).  
During these three seconds, press the relevant arrow key to insert a new row or column to the right or left, above or below the current row or column.  
If you hold down the (Command) (Ctrl) key as well as the arrow key, the adjacent cell will be split.  
To delete a column or row, first of all switch the table to the delete mode for tables by pressing (Option) (Alt) (Del).  
During these three seconds, press the relevant cursor key to delete a row or column to the right or left, above or below the current row or column.  
If you hold down the (Command) (Ctrl) key as well as the arrow key, the current cell will be merged with the adjacent cell into one cell.  
Deleting Tables  
You have the following options:  
Select from the end of the paragraph before the table to the start of the paragraph after the table.  
Press (Del) or Backspace.  
Or place the cursor in the table, select all cells, for example by pressing (Command) (Ctrl) (A), open the context menu and select Row - Delete.  
This method also works at the beginning or end of a document.  
Inserting Tables  
There are various ways of inserting a table in your text document:  
To insert a blank table with the mouse:  
Place the cursor at the position in the text where you want to insert the table.  
Point with the mouse to the Insert table icon on the Insert floating toolbar.  
Press the mouse button and move the mouse down and to the right until the required numbers of rows and columns appear in the preview area under the icon.  
Then release the mouse button. (If you want to abort the process, before releasing the button move the mouse up or to the left until the word Cancel appears in the preview area.)  
To inserting a blank table via dialog:  
Place the cursor at the position in the text where you want to insert the table.  
Click briefly on the Insert table icon on the Insert floating toolbar.  
This opens the Insert Table dialog.  
Inserting from %PRODUCTNAME Calc with the clipboard  
Open your text document and a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document from which you want to insert a range of cells.  
Select a range of cells from the spreadsheet.  
Copy it to the clipboard, for example with (Ctrl)(C).  
Switch to the text document.  
You now have various options for inserting the range of cells:  
You can use the "normal" command Edit - Paste or (Ctrl)(V) to insert the range of cells as an OLE object.  
You can double-click on the OLE object in order to edit it with %PRODUCTNAME Calc tools and commands.  
Click outside the object to quit edit mode.  
Choose Edit - Paste Special to open the Paste Special dialog, where you have several options to choose from.  
The same options can also be found on the submenu of the Paste icon on the Function Bar:  
Options  
Is inserted as...  
"%PRODUCTNAME 6.0 Spreadsheet" or "Star Embed Source"  
OLE object - as with (Ctrl)(V) or drag-and-drop  
GDIMetaFile  
Graphic  
Bitmap

HTML  
HTML table  
Unformatted text  
Text only, tab stops as separators  
Formatted text [RTF]  
Text table  
DDE link (only under Windows)  
Table structure and contents, without formatting.  
With updating  
Inserting from %PRODUCTNAME Calc using drag-and-drop  
Open your text document and a %PRODUCTNAME Calc document from which you want to insert a range of cells.  
Select a range of cells from the spreadsheet.  
Click in the selected range of cells and hold down the mouse button.  
Wait a moment.  
Without releasing the mouse button, drag the selected range of cells into the text document.  
If the text document is not visible, first move the mouse pointer to the text document icon on the task bar and wait a moment until the text document opens.  
In the text document, a gray insertion cursor follows the mouse pointer, showing you where the table can be placed.  
Release the mouse button when the gray insertion cursor is in the place where you would like the table to be inserted.  
Adapting Table Widths  
You can also click the icons in the Table object bar to switch between the attributes Fixed, Fixed/Proportional, and Variable.  
Table Mode Fixed means, for example, that if you make one cell wider the adjacent cell will become narrower.  
Other cells will not be affected, and the overall width of the table stays the same.  
In other words, wide cells will shrink more than narrow ones.  
Again, table width remains constant.  
Whenever an individual cell is made wider, the entire width of the table expands as well.  
When you insert or delete (cells, rows or columns), the table mode decides how the neighboring cells, rows or columns should behave.  
In the table mode, new rows and columns are only inserted in a fixed way if there is sufficient space.  
Repeating Several Heading Rows in Tables  
Within a table, if you want to automatically repeat more than one row following a page break, this is how to do it:  
Select the first table row.  
Open the context menu and choose Cell - Split.  
In the Split Cells dialog, select the "horizontal" direction.  
Enter the number of rows that are to be repeated and confirm your choice with "Ok".  
All rows at the beginning of the table created in this way will now be repeated after a page break.  
Enlarging and Reducing Cells in Text Tables  
You can change the width and height of rows and columns using the keyboard, by dragging and dropping with the mouse or by commands in the context menu.  
You can also change the column width numerically via a dialog.  
You can also distribute rows and columns evenly with the icons on the Optimize floating toolbar on the Table Object Bar.  
With the mouse, you can modify rows and columns either in the table directly, or with the aid of the rulers.  
If you rest the mouse on a vertical dividing line in the table, the pointer appears as a separator symbol, and you can simply drag the dividing line to the desired position. (You may need to click once outside the table before this procedure will work.) You can move the dividing lines on the ruler in the same way.  
When you enlarge and reduce using the keyboard, you must always hold down the (Option) (Alt) key.  
If you also press one of the four arrow keys, the current column or row will be enlarged or reduced by an amount that you can set under Tools - Options - Text Document - Table under Keyboard handling, with rows and columns being handled separately.  
The current row or column is enlarged or reduced at its right-hand or lower edge.  
If you press the Shift key as well as (Option) (Alt), the left-hand or upper edge will be moved.  
Here are two examples:  
Position the cursor in the middle of a medium to large text table.  
Hold down the (Option) (Alt) key, and press the right arrow key.  
The current column will be expanded by the amount specified in the tab Table under Tools - Options - Text Document.  
The left edge of the column remains fixed while the right edge moves.  
Now, hold down the (Option) (Alt) key together with the Shift key and press the right arrow key.  
The right edge remains fixed and the left edge moves to the right, thus reducing the column.  
However, since the rows are preset to a minimum height, you must first enlarge them before you can see the result.  
If you also press the (Command) (Ctrl) key during the process, the enlargement or reduction applies only to the active cell instead of to the entire row or column.  
The proportions of the table remain fixed.  
Creating Document Templates  
To make your user-defined Paragraph or Character Styles available in other documents, you need to create a template.  
The template contains all the Styles from the current document.  
If you want, you can delete all text from the current document, leaving only the Styles.  
You can apply Styles from one text document to another text document:  
Choose Format - Styles - Load.  
Call the menu command File - Templates - Save.  
In the dialog Document Templates, select the category in which you would like to save your template.  
In the New Template text field, enter the name for your template and click OK.  
Later, you can open a dialog with File - New - Templates and Documents and select a template to be used in creating a document.  
The defined Text and Paragraph Styles will then be available for the new document.  
File - Templates - Save  
Defining Default Templates  
If you find you always have to change the formatting of your new documents to suit your requirements, it is time to use a separate template, known as the default template.  
This default template will be used every time you open a new text document, by choosing File - New - Text Document, for example.  
Create or open a document that contains your favorite Styles and formatting.  
You can delete the text of the document if you want, so that only the Styles and other settings remain.  
Save the document as template by choosing File - Templates - Save.  
Doing so saves the document as a template in {installpath}/user/template {installpath}\user\template.  
Choose File - Templates - Organize.  
In the left list box of templates, double-click "Default".  
The name of the default template you have saved will appear.  
Click the name.  
Open the context menu and choose Set as Default Template.  
Close the dialog.  
This template will now be used as the default template.  
Reset Default Template  
Choose File - Templates - Organize.  
Open the context menu of one of the list boxes or open the submenu of the Commands button.  
Choose Reset Default Template.  
This command opens a submenu in which you see every document type for which you have selected a default template.  
Select the document type you want to assign the default settings to.  
Templates and Styles  
The templates in %PRODUCTNAME are files you can use as basis for creating your own documents.  
Templates can contain text, logos, other graphic objects etc.  
In addition, every template contains a large number of Styles, all of which can be viewed in the Stylist.  
For each document type (text, table, drawing, presentation etc.), a single template file is defined as the default template (file): this is always used when, for example, you create a new (usually empty) document with File - New.  
Nearly every document type has its own template.  
Lists of the different templates for text documents can be found in the %PRODUCTNAME Help about text documents.  
The same applies to templates for presentations and spreadsheets.  
Choose Format - Styles - Catalog to open a dialog offering different Styles depending on the nature of the current document.  
For example, if you opened a text document and call this command, the dialog will look like this:  
Here, as in the Stylist, you can select the type of Styles from a list box, modify the Styles belonging to this type, delete Styles you have created yourself and create new Styles.  
However, you can also click Organizer.  
Then you will see a dialog with contents similar to the following illustration:  
You can use this dialog to copy the Styles contained in a particular template or in a particular document individually to another document.  
Look at the illustration.  
If you double-click the name of a folder in the left window you will see below it all the templates contained in that folder.  
Double-clicking one of these files causes the two categories Styles and Configuration to appear.  
Once again, double-click to open a list of the objects contained.  
But in the case of a document you will only see the Styles that are actually used in that document.  
Either the mouse pointer is a circle with a line through it, in which case you cannot move the content to that place, or the mouse pointer has an insert line that tells you the place where the content will be moved to when you release the mouse button.  
Aligning Text With Lines  
Aligning text with freeform line  
Draw the freeform line (Draw Functions floating toolbar).  
Double-click on the line.  
Enter the desired text or copy it from the clipboard.  
Choose Format - FontWork.  
Click for example on the Rotate icon.  
Aligning text with straight lines  
If you want to slant a text, so that it runs precisely from one point on the text page to another point, this is what you do:  
Using the draw functions, draw a straight line from one point to another.  
In the list box on the object bar, select the line style "Invisible".  
Double-click exactly between them.  
Enter the text, then click outside the line object.  
Using Text Animation  
This is how to do it:  
1.  
Open a new, blank %PRODUCTNAME Writer document.  
2.  
Select Format - Page to select a background for the whole page.  
3.  
Open the Draw Functions floating toolbar from the main toolbar and click the Rectangle icon.  
4.  
Create a rectangle in the center of the page:  
5.  
Open the context menu for the selected drawing object.  
6.  
Choose the Area command to assign a color or pattern to the area inside the rectangle.  
7.  
On the left side of the Area tab page, select the option Gradients and choose e.g. "gradient 4".  
Close the dialog with OK.  
8.  
Open the context menu once more and select the Line... command to define the border properties of the rectangle.  
9.  
For the line, choose a color and a width.  
Close the dialog with OK.  
10.  
Double-click in the middle of the rectangle and type your text.  
It does not matter if the text extends beyond the width of the rectangle.  
11.  
Then open the context menu and select Text.  
12.  
In the Text dialog, click the Text Animation tab.  
Under Text Animation select Effects and in the combo box the option "Scroll Through".  
On the Text tab page you can set the distance from the left and right borders. (The border of a frame goes half inside and half outside.) Click OK.  
13.  
Now you just have to undo the selection of the rectangle by clicking on another place in the document.  
In a moment the text animation will start to run.  
14.  
To change the size of the animated text, select the rectangle again and double-click in the center.  
Now you can select the text and apply a larger font size.  
You can enlarge or reduce the page view either by choosing View - Zoom or via the context menu of the scale field on the status bar.  
If the screen display is to be refreshed, press Shift+ Command Ctrl +R.  
Writing in Uppercase or Lowercase  
How can text be changed to uppercase or lowercase letters?  
You have the following options for re-formatting text in uppercase or lowercase.  
Decide whether you want to apply a font effect to the text for display and printing purposes only, or whether you want to replace the characters permanently.  
Display in uppercase:  
Select the text and choose Format - Character - Font Effects tab, and under Effects select Capitals.  
Display in lowercase:  
Select the text and choose Format - Character - Font Effects tab, and under Effects select Lowercase.  
Convert to uppercase:  
Select text, then choose Format - Case/Characters - Uppercase.  
Convert to lowercase:  
Centering Text Vertically on the Page  
If you want to center a text vertically between the top and bottom margins, this is how to do it:  
1.  
Select the text.  
2.  
On the Insert floating toolbar at the top of the main toolbar, click on the Insert Frame Manually icon.  
3.  
Create a frame on the page.  
The selected text will automatically appear in the frame.  
4.  
Format the text and adjust the size of the frame so that it encloses the text as snugly as possible.  
To format the text, you first have to select it.  
To do this, undo the selection of the frame by clicking once outside the frame and then directly in the text.  
To select the frame itself later on, click on the frame border.  
5.  
Open the context menu of the frame and change the anchor to "To Page".  
6.  
Now you can use the mouse to drag the text frame to any position on the page.  
You can also use the icons in the Object bar to move the frame horizontally and/or vertically to one side or to the middle.  
7.  
You can call up the Frame dialog whenever the frame is selected (i.e., the eight handles are visible) by means of a double-click so that you can edit the properties of the frame.  
8.  
Switch to the Borders tab of the Frame dialog and switch off the border, which would otherwise be printed:  
Under Line arrangement click the left icon that shows no lines.  
The frame will lose its printable border.  
If you also want to switch off the gray border, which is visible but not printed, use the command View - Text Boundaries.  
Entering Text Anywhere on a Page  
The direct cursor enables you to enter text at any position within the type area in your text document.  
1.  
Click the Direct Cursor on/off icon on the main toolbar.  
Clicking the icon turns the direct cursor on and off.  
When the icon appears pressed, the direct cursor is enabled.

3.  
Enter your text. %PRODUCTNAME automatically inserts the requisite number of blank lines, tabs and spaces.  
Inserting External Text Documents  
If you want to insert text from another text document in the current text document, there are several ways of doing this:  
You can copy the external text to the clipboard and paste it to the current document.  
This is quick and easy, but if the external document is subsequently changed, this will not be reflected in the current document.  
You can insert the external text as a link.  
This is more complicated, because you first have to define a section in the current document, then insert the external text in it as a link.  
The advantage here is that changes to the external document are automatically reflected in the current document.  
When you insert the external text in a text frame, you can control the positioning and location of the text on your page in advance, even before the external text is ready - and this may be important when creating something like a company newsletter.  
Linked frames allow you to define how external text should be spread over several pages.  
If you want to have text in frames, create a frame (main toolbar, Insert floating toolbar, Frame icon).  
If you want the text in several linked frames, create all of these frames.  
To work with linked frames, in which the text flows automatically from one frame to the next, define a link via the Link icon in the Object bar.  
Place the cursor at the point where the external text should begin.  
Choose the Insert - Section... command.  
The Insert Section dialog appears.  
Mark the Link check box.  
Now you can click on Browse and select the external text document.  
Otherwise, the whole document is inserted.  
In the text box you can enter a name for the section.  
This name will be displayed in the Navigator, for example.  
Click Insert and close the dialog with the Close button.  
The external text document is inserted as a linked section.  
Merging Text Documents  
This is how you can append an existing text document to another text document.  
Place the cursor at the end of the first document and select Insert - File...  
In the dialog which then appears, select and load the relevant document.  
The document is then inserted at the end of the first document.  
Emphasizing Text  
There are many ways of emphasizing text in a special way.  
Here are some of them:  
Some possibilities are: create the text in bold or in another font style, change the text color and background, or center the text.  
If you want to visually emphasize a whole paragraph, open its context menu and select Paragraph, then click on, for example, the Borders tab.  
Here you can select a border to frame the paragraph, and also a shadow if desired.  
If necessary you can change the interval between the border and the paragraph text under Spacing to contents.  
Enter the text in a Text Frame.  
The text can receive a border, it can be placed outside of the text margin on the side of the page, and you can link text frames if a text should flow from one frame to another.  
Choose Format - Paragraph - Background to apply a background color to the paragraph.  
Use the Text drawing function:  
With the Text icon on the Draw function floating toolbar (from the main toolbar), drag open a frame and enter your text.  
This text can be positioned as you like, which includes rotating at various angles, or curving and slanting your text with the help of Format - FontWork.  
Format - FontWork  
Entering New Text  
To enter new text:  
Open an existing text document or create a new one.  
Enter text using the keyboard.  
If you want to enter special characters which are not available on your keyboard, choose Insert - Special Character and select the desired character from the table.  
Press Enter to begin a new paragraph.  
Line breaks  
You do not need to worry about line breaks as the software inserts these automatically.  
Only press Enter where you want to start a new paragraph.  
Automatic correction  
For example, it can automatically start every sentence with a capital letter.  
Word completion  
The automatic word completion helps you enter text.  
If you often use the same, long word, %PRODUCTNAME Writer will suggest the recognized word.  
Press Enter (or you can define another key) to accept the suggestion.  
Word Completion  
Inserting, Editing and Linking Text Frames  
Inserting Text Frames  
Place the text in a text frame.  
To insert text in a text frame after you have already typed it in, proceed as follows:  
1.  
Select the text that is to be in the frame.  
2.  
Long-click the Insert icon on the main toolbar and open its floating toolbar.  
On the Insert floating toolbar, press the mouse button on the Insert frame manually icon.  
While still pressing the mouse button, move the pointer down a bit and select the desired amount of columns by highlighting them in the window that appears.  
Release the mouse button when you have selected the desired number.  
3.  
If you now move the mouse cursor into the text document, a cross-hair symbol indicates that you can drag open a frame.  
If you decide not to do so, press the Escape key to change the cursor back to a text cursor again.  
4.  
With the crosshairs, create a selection frame which defines the new location for the paragraph.  
The selected text is now automatically deleted from the normal, continuous text and inserted in a text frame.  
Click the edge of the text frame to select it.  
You can recognize a selected text frame by the eight handles that appear, four of which are located in the corners and one in the middle of each side.  
Editing Text Frames  
Once you have selected a text frame, you can change it by dragging and dropping with the mouse button pressed.  
By dragging the edge (not one of the handles), you move the whole frame.  
Dragging one of the handles changes the size of the frame.  
The corner or side opposite the one you are dragging stays in the same place.  
Dragging a handle on one of the sides enlarges or compresses the text frame in one direction only, whereas dragging a corner handle enlarges or reduces it in both dimensions.  
If you hold down the Shift key while dragging one of the eight handles, the frame will retain the same proportions, in other words the side ratios remain constant.  
The options in the context menu of a selected frame allow you to make further adjustments.  
From the context menu of a text frame you can select, for example, the Alignment relative to other frames, drawing objects, graphics etc.  
Use the Wrap submenu to choose whether and on what side the normal text of your document should wrap around the text frame.  
Clicking on Frame in the context menu is the same as choosing Format - Frame from the menu bar.  
This opens a dialog giving you access to all properties of the frame.  
The functions available in text frames are the same as in text documents.  
In addition to text, frames can contain pictures, multiple columns, etc.  
Linking Text Frames  
You can link several text frames to each other even when they are on different pages of a document.  
The text will automatically flow from one to the other.  
1.  
In order to create a link, click the edge of the frame you want to link.  
Eight handles will appear around the edges.  
2.  
Click the Link icon on the object bar.  
3.  
Click the frame that is to be linked.  
When a linked frame is selected, any existing links are indicated by a connecting line.  
The height of a frame that is linked with a subsequent frame is automatically fixed.  
The height is no longer automatically adapted to the content of the frame.  
Only the height of the last frame of a chain can be adapted to the text content.  
If you click the Link of the object bar when a frame is selected, the cursor changes.  
It can now display two icons: a chain with an arrow if two frames can be linked by clicking, or a chain with a stop sign if linking is not possible where the cursor is positioned.  
A note is displayed in the status bar in each case, e.g., why linking is not possible.  
Linking is only possible from one frame to the next.  
That means that a frame that is already linked to a frame cannot be linked to another frame which follows.  
Therefore, the link icon cannot be activated if a frame already has a next link.  
Also, two frames can only be unlinked with the Unlink Frames icon from the first frame.  
The linking of frames is not allowed under the following conditions:  
The target is not empty.  
An (automatically) captioned frame is not empty and can therefore not be the target of a link.  
The target already has a previous link.  
Source and target are in different sections, e.g. one frame is in a header and the other frame is in a footer.  
The source already has a next link.  
Source and target are the same.  
Closed chains or chains from the inside out or from the outside in are also not permissible.  
The latter is the case if you inserted a frame into another frame and want to link them with each other.  
Inserting Text  
Open an existing document.  
Using the mouse or the arrow keys, place the cursor at the point where text is to be added, and enter new text.  
By default, you are in Insert mode; text after the insertion point is moved on as you enter the new text.  
If you would like the existing text at this point to be overwritten with the new text, select Overwrite mode.  
Navigating and Selecting With the Keyboard  
To navigate and select with the keyboard, in addition to the arrow keys you can also use Home, End, PgUp and PgDn.  
Certain keys have different functions depending on whether they are used on their own or in combination with the Command Ctrl key.  
The following table provides an overview of the keys used for navigation.

Rotating Text  
If you want to rotate text, type it into a text frame:  
Open the Draw Functions floating toolbar on the main toolbar.  
On the floating toolbar, click on the Text icon.  
The mouse pointer now indicates that you can open up a text frame.  
Open up a text frame, release the mouse button and type in your text.  
Click on the edge of the text frame.  
You will now see the Draw Object Bar, which contains the Object Rotation Mode icon.  
Click on it.  
Now, if you click on one of the handles in the corners of the text frame and drag the mouse, the whole text frame turns with the text.  
In the context menu of the Text Frame, you can start the Position and Size dialog by selecting the Rotation tab.  
This allows you to define the precise angle of rotation numerically.  
Draw Functions - Text  
Selecting and Deleting Text  
Deleting a character  
If the cursor is after the character to be deleted, press Backspace (above the Enter key).  
This key deletes one character to the left of the cursor.  
If the cursor is before the character to be deleted, press the Delete key (above the arrow keys).  
This key deletes one character to the right of the cursor.  
Deleting text  
Selecting text to delete with the mouse  
Left-click on the first character to be deleted.  
Keeping the mouse button depressed, drag the pointer to the last character to be deleted.  
Release the mouse button.  
Press the Delete key to delete the selected text.  
Selecting text to delete with the keyboard  
Use the arrow keys to go to the first character to be deleted.  
Hold down the Shift key.  
Using the arrow keys, move the cursor to just after the last character to be deleted.  
Release the Shift key.  
The text appears selected.  
Press the Delete key to delete the selected text.  
This cuts out the text and places it on the clipboard.  
You can then paste it back in, wherever and as often as you like, by pressing Command Ctrl +V.  
Deleting non-adjacent pieces of text.  
Press Command Ctrl and keep it pressed.  
Click Left-click on the first character of the first piece of text to be deleted.  
Keeping the mouse button depressed, drag the pointer to the last character of this piece of text.  
Release the mouse button and the Command Ctrl key.  
Repeat steps 1 to 4 for each piece of text to be deleted.  
Press the Delete key to delete the selected text.  
Footnotes and Endnotes  
You can display footnotes in a text document at the bottom of a page (or column if you are using more than one column) or at the end of a document.  
The settings are defined by choosing Tools - Footnotes.  
The following information is also valid for endnotes.  
Endnotes are footnotes that appear collectively at the end of a document instead of at the foot of each page.  
You can jump from a footnote anchor in the document to the footnote text quite easily by clicking on the footnote anchor.  
Press PgUp to return from the footnote to the text.  
The footnote format can be changed by modifying the Paragraph Style "Footnote," which is automatically applied to all footnotes in a document.  
To delete a footnote, simply delete the footnote mark in the text.  
The footnote text will automatically be deleted as well.  
Hyphenation  
You can carry out hyphenation in text documents either automatically or manually.  
Automatic hyphenation is an attribute of paragraphs and Paragraph Styles.  
This means that you can switch the hyphenation on or off for a paragraph or for a paragraph format and select its properties.  
Manual hyphenation gives you individual control, but is time-consuming.  
Automatic hyphenation  
Automatic hyphenation is turned off by default.  
If you want to switch on hyphenation for one or more selected paragraphs, open the context menu and select paragraph.  
If you want to switch on hyphenation for all paragraphs formatted with a certain Paragraph Style, open the context menu in one of the paragraphs and select Edit Paragraph Style.  
To use hyphenation in all paragraphs, edit the Default Paragraph Style from which the other Paragraph Styles are derived.  
In the next dialog, click on the Text Flow tab.  
Under Hyphenation, mark Automatically.  
Manual Hyphenation  
For manual hyphenation, place the cursor at the point where the word should be separated and press (Command) (Ctrl) (-).  
The word will be separated if it is possible, even if automatic hyphenation is turned off for the paragraph.  
If you have entered a hyphen directly, %PRODUCTNAME will not apply the automatic hyphenation for that word.  
Let's assume the word "Antarctica" would be hyphenated:  
An-tarcti-ca, but you want it:  
Ant-arc-ti-ca.  
Enter all three hyphens manually (directly), including the one between "i" and "ca" that is the same as in the automatic hyphenation.  
There is a quick way to prevent a particular word from being affected by the hyphenation (or spellcheck) functionality:  
On the Font tab select Language None.  
If you want to permanently prevent a word from being automatically hyphenated, so that it will never be separated, place it in an active user-defined dictionary with an equals sign after it:  
Choose Tools - Options - Language Settings - Writing Aids  
Select a User-defined dictionary and click the Edit button.  
If you do not yet have a user-defined dictionary, you can create one by clicking the New button.  
In the next dialog Edit Custom Dictionary enter the word, for example, "Companyname=" (without quotation marks) and close the dialog with Close and OK.  
Now, the word "Companyname" will never be hyphenated.  
You do not have to search through the text yourself to find words to hyphenate manually.  
Choose Tools - Hyphenation.  
This starts a dialog showing, one after the other, all words that could be hyphenated with the current line break.  
The place at which the word could best be hyphenated with the current line break is highlighted.  
Click on the left arrow button to move the highlighting to the left if you would like the word to be hyphenated at an earlier place.  
Then you will see the next word that could be hyphenated.  
If the spellcheck recognizes the word, the hyphens entered there will be displayed as well.  
Text Flow  
Turning Numbering On and Off  
This is how to turn numbering on and off:  
1.  
Select the paragraphs you want to number.  
2.  
Click on the Numbering on/off icon on the Text Object Bar.  
The paragraphs are formatted as a numbered list.  
In an existing numbered list, if you click on the Numbering on/off icon, the paragraphs will turn back into normal text.  
Like bulleted lists, the best way to control numbered lists is with the icons on the Numbering Object Bar.  
When you move a numbered list down a level, the subordinate numbered list at this level starts from one again.  
To access these options, choose Format - Numbering/Bullets - Options.  
Example  
1.  
Line one  
2. and line two  
1. and a sublevel of line 2  
In this example, the list is not fully numbered.  
The full number of the last line with the sublevel of 2. would be 2.1.  
Turning Bullets On and Off  
This is how to turn a bulleted list on and off:  
1.  
Place the cursor in a paragraph that you would like to mark with a bullet symbol, or select a number of paragraphs.  
2.  
Click on the Bullets on/off icon on the Text Object Bar.  
The paragraph or paragraphs will be formatted as a bulleted list.  
3.  
In an existing bulleted list, if you click on the Bullets on/off icon, the paragraphs will turn back into normal text.  
4.  
In a bulleted list, clicking on the icon at the far right of the object bar changes the Text Object Bar to the Numbering Object Bar.  
You can also select which bar to display by opening the context menu on the object bar.  
The Numbering Object Bar contains icons for moving and rearranging numbered paragraphs.  
You can select further settings for the bulleted list in which your cursor is positioned with the Format - Numbering/Bullets dialog.  
If you would like a different bullet symbol, you can select one under Format - Numbering/Bullets - Options by clicking on the button with three dots, which opens the Special Characters dialog.  
You can only see this button if you selected "Bullet" in the Numbering combo box.  
Numbering and Numbering Styles  
You can apply numbering in your text either as direct formatting or by using a Style, just as you can with other paragraph attributes such as "Justified" or "Line Spacing".  
The icons on the numbering object bar and the options in the Format - Numbering/Bullets dialog apply direct formatting.  
Direct formatting is also applied when you use automatic numbering via the AutoFormat/AutoCorrect function.  
The AutoNumbering of AutoCorrect is not applied to the Styles listed in the Stylist under "Special Styles".  
You can apply a particular Numbering Style to certain Paragraph Styles or apply the Numbering Style directly to the paragraphs.  
In those cases, you can take advantage of the paragraph formatting system for numbering as well.  
When you change the Numbering Style, all numbering that you have created with this Style will be automatically reformatted.  
The Numbering Styles are described in the %PRODUCTNAME Help.  
Thesaurus  
You can use the thesaurus to look up related words.  
Within your text, select the word you want to look up in the thesaurus.  
Choose Tools - Thesaurus or press (Command) (Ctrl) (F7).  
In the dialog which then appears, you can scroll down the two lower list boxes until you find a suitable word.  
If you close the dialog by clicking on OK, the selected word will be replaced by the word in the Replace field.  
The thesaurus is not available in all languages for which a spellcheck has been installed.  
If you are looking for alternatives for a word in another language for which a thesaurus is installed, for example an English word, select the word in the text and call up the thesaurus.  
Click on the Language button to switch to "English (UK)" or "English (US)", in order to select British or North American style.  
Then click on Search.  
If you applied English language attributes to the English words in your text (Format - Character, Font tab, Language list box), then the spellcheck, thesaurus and hyphenation will automatically be in this language.  
You can assign a language to Paragraph Styles in the same way.  
Thesaurus  
Counting Words in Text  
Here's how to determine the number of words in a text document.  
The number of words will be displayed on the Statistics tab, along with other statistics.  
File - Properties - Statistics  
TextWrap Around Objects  
You can select a different method of TextWrap for each object.  
Select the object and open the context menu.  
The Wrap command of the context menu presents you with the main options.  
The currently applicable option is indicated in the submenu by a spot.  
Click on the Wrap option that you would like to set for the selected object.  
Click on the Wrap tab in the dialog.  
The individual options are described in %PRODUCTNAME -Help.  
This dialog also allows you to set the formatting or Wrap Contour options.  
If you mark Contour, the text will follow the contours of the object.  
You can only select contour wrapping if you have selected a wrap - if Wrap Through is selected, no wrapping will take place.  
If you also mark Outside only, the text will not run into the interior of open objects.  
Look at the illustration, which shows one object with the Outside only option and one without this option.  
To edit the contour of an embedded graphic - if you feel this is necessary -use the Contour Editor.  
You use it in generally the same way as the ImageMap Editor; a detailed description is given in %PRODUCTNAME Help.
